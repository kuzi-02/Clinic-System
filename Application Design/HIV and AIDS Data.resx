    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...

    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter

PREFACE
Ever since the beginning of AIDS epidemic in 1981, the number of people infected and
affected by HIV/AIDS is on the rise. During the course of infection, a broad range of
physical, social and psychological needs and problems is experienced. Changing nature of
the illness imposes a variety of psychological and emotional strains on individuals and those
closest to them. Taking into account the dilemmas associated with it, the effects of HIV epidemic
are enormous. AIDS, in fact, is seen more as a psychosocial phenomenon than a disease.
HIV/AIDS counselling assists people to make informed decisions, cope better with their
condition, lead more positive lives, and prevent HIV transmission. HIV/AIDS counselling is
important because infection with HIV is life long. Role of counselling in HIV/AIDS is perhaps
more important than in any other disease.
Existence of standard guidelines for the people involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and control
activities ensures that all efforts being made for the purpose are well coordinated and in right
direction. Moreover, it is important to have guidelines written in the context of one's own culture,
financial and resource constraints and prevailing socio-medical standards. Counselling is actually
a highly specialized field and very little is available in Pakistan on the subject, particularly in the
context of HIV/AIDS. The in hand knowledge is, therefore, required to be regularly updated and
disseminated to those who are in need of it.
Keeping this in view and for a systematic dissemination of the available knowledge to the
concerned professionals, National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) and Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Pakistan decided to develop national guidelines on
Counselling for HIV/AIDS. These guidelines have been developed and reviewed by renowned
practicing experts in their work field.
Purpose of the counselling guidelines is to provide an in-depth knowledge on the subject to the
clinicians, laboratory professionals, psychiatrists and the social workers, both in the public as well
as private sectors, that would help them to manage HIV/AIDS and prevent its further spread.
The guidelines describe the role and mechanism of counselling in different circumstances that
are likely to be experienced by the people involved in AIDS prevention activities in one way or
the other. The readers desirous of detailed information may consult the guidelines on Clinical
Management and HIV Antibody Testing developed by the NACP and UNAIDS Pakistan.
Although a great effort has been put in to ensure a really useful and practicable manuscript yet
there would be ample space for improvement, since the exercise has been carried out for the first
time in Pakistan. Any suggestion, guidance and critique from the working specialists would be
warmly welcome as it remains the main tool to enhance the quality of this manuscript in the years
to come.

INTRODUCTION
GLOBAL SITUATION OF HIV/AIDS:
pread of HIV and development of
AIDS are being closely monitored
worldwide. UNAIDS and WHO
estimate that the number of people living
with HIV/AIDS at the end of the year 2000
stands at 36.1 million including 16.4
million women. This is 50 % higher than
what WHO's global programme on AIDS
projected in 1991 on the basis of available
data at that time. 5.3 million persons were
newly infected with HIV while 3 million
deaths occurred due to AIDS during the
year 2000, bringing the total death toll to
21.8 million since the beginning of the
epidemic.
Recent evidence affirms that the disease
is spreading in Asia faster than anywhere
else in the world and perhaps as fast as it
did in Africa, a decade ago. An estimated
700,000 adults, 450,000 of them men,
have become infected in south and southeast
Asia in the course of the year 2000.
Overall, as of end 2000, the region is
estimated to have 5.8 million adults and
children living with HIV/AIDS
HIV/AIDS IN PAKISTAN:
Since the official recognition of the first
case in 1987, the number of officially
reported HIV infections and AIDS cases
has grown to 1787 (as of March 2001).
Unfortunately, most observers believe that
the number of reported cases represents
only the "tip of the iceberg", and that the
number of actual cases may be far
greater. Although the exact figures are not
available at the moment, according to the
WHO/UNAIDS forecast model, currently
there are estimated 60,000 to 74,000 HIV
infected individuals. However, a study is
underway to ascertain the number of STD
cases in each province, and these figures
can be extrapolated to provide a more
realistic figure of the true picture of AIDS
in Pakistan. Because the greatest form of
HIV transmission is through sexual
contact, these STD figures will provide
some insight into the number of people
who could be potentially susceptible to
HIV.
The groups at increased risk of acquiring
the HIV. infection have been defined in
Pakistan and are the persons with risky
behaviour, blood and blood product
recipients, IV drug addicts, STD patients,
professional blood donors and seamen.
There are more than three million
nationals working abroad with their
families based in Pakistan. A large
number of immigrants especially from
Afghanistan and international tourists
come to visit Pakistan. There is low
literacy rate among the general public with
insufficient awareness regarding
HIV/AIDS transmission.
Compared to many parts of the world,
Pakistan is in a fortunate position in
having small numbers of HIV infected
people. However, experience has shown
that if HIV is not controlled, these figures
will rise rapidly, and a full epidemic could
result. From experience with other
countries in the world, it has been found
that HIV counselling is one of the most
important and effective interventions in
HIV prevention and care. Not only does
effective HIV counselling promote
behavioural change and risk reduction
activities, but counselling also provides
people living with HIV/AIDS a better
quality of life, and to experience a more
peaceful death.
What is HIV and AIDS?
In 1983, scientists in France discovered
the virus that causes AIDS and routes of
its transmission were confirmed. The virus
eventually became known as the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There are 2
different types of HIV, which cause AIDS:
(a) HIV-1, the most common type found
worldwide, and (b) HIV-2 found mostly in
West Africa.
HIV infection affects the immune system
resulting in its weakness called
S
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 9
immunodeficiency. Immune system
provides the body's defence against the
micro-organisms (such as bacteria,
viruses fungi etc) that penetrate the skin
and mucous membranes and cause
disease. In a healthy person, the immune
system produces antibodies to fight off or
kill these micro-organisms thereby
preventing the occurrence of disease. In
an immuno-deficient individual this ability
to combat disease causing germs is lost
by the following mechanism:
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infects and eventually destroys the
lymphocytes and monocytes of the
immune system. These cells carry the
CD4 antigen on their surface (CD4+
lymphocytes). HIV having special affinity
for the CD4 antigen enters and infects
CD4+ lymphocytes resulting in killing of
many CD4+ lymphocytes. This slowly
leads to a persistent, progressive and
profound impairment of the immune
system, making an individual susceptible
to opportunistic infections and conditions
such as cancer.
HIV is the beginning stage of infection.
The person remains symptomless and
HIV antibodies can be detected only by a
blood test. The infection gradually
progresses to AIDS when the immune
system becomes very affected resulting in
appearance of certain opportunistic
infections and cancers.
HIV TRANSMISSION
There are many myths and
misunderstandings about the mode of
transmission of HIV. It is very important for
a counsellor to understand the modes of
transmission so that effective HIV
counselling can take place.
HIV Can be transmitted by:
a) Sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal
and oral) or through contact with
infected blood, semen, or cervical
and vaginal fluids. This is the most
frequent mode of transmission and
HIV can be transmitted from any
infected person to his or her sexual
partner; man to woman, woman to
man, man to man, and (but less
likely) woman to woman. Other
sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs) (especially those causing
genital ulcers) increase the risk of
HIV transmission because more
mucous membrane is exposed to the
virus
b) Transfusion of blood or blood products
obtained from an infected donor.
c) Injecting or skin-piercing equipment
contaminated with HIV
d) Mother to infant during pregnancy,
labour, or as a result of breast
feeding
HIV cannot be transmitted by
the routine contact/activities
such as:
(a) Coughing or sneezing
(b) Handshakes
(c) Insect bites
(d) Work or school contact
(e) Touching or hugging
(f) Using toilets
(g) Water or food
(h) Using telephones
(i) Kissing
(j) Swimming pools
(k) Public baths
(I) Sharing cups, glasses, plates and
other eating and drinking utensils.
Natural History of HIV
Infection:
Natural history of HIV/AIDS can be
studied under following phases:
(a) Acute HIV Infection:
Most people infected with HIV do not
know that they have become infected.
Antibodies to HIV antigens are usually
developed 6 weeks to 3 months after
being infected. In some individuals, the
test may not be positive until 6 months or
longer (although this would be considered
unusual). This time is known as the "the
window period" during which the person
can be highly infectious and yet unaware
of their condition. The term seroCounselling
for HIV/AIDS 10
conversion is used when a person
recently infected with HIV tests seropositive
for HIV antibodies.
(b) HIV Infection before the
onset of symptoms
In adults, there is often a long, silent
period of HIV infection before the disease
progresses to full blown AIDS. A person
infected with HIV may have no symptoms
for up to 10 years or more. The vast
majority of HIV-infected children are
infected in the peri-natal period (during
pregnancy and childbirth). The period
without symptoms is shorter in children,
with a few infants becoming ill in the first
few weeks of life.
(c) Progression from HIV
infection to HIV-related
disease and AIDS
Almost all (if not all) HIV-infected people
will ultimately develop HIV-related disease
and AIDS. This progression depends on
the type and strain of the virus and certain
host characteristics. Factors that may
cause faster progression include age less
than 5 years, or over 40 years, other
infections and possibly genetic
(hereditary) factors. HIV infects both the
central and the peripheral nervous system
early in the course of infection. This
causes a variety of neurological and
neuro-psychiatric conditions. As HIV
infection progresses and the person's
immunity declines, people become more
susceptible to opportunistic infections and
cancers. These include: Tuberculosis,
sexually transmitted diseases,
septicaemia, pneumonia (usually
pneumocystis carinii), recurrent fungal
infections of the skin, mouth and throat,
other skin diseases, unexplained fever,
unexplained weight loss (also known as
AIDS-related complex ARC), chronic
diarrhoea with weight loss (often known as
"slim disease"), meningitis, other diseases
such as cancers (e.g. Kaposi sarcoma).
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 11
THE PURPOSE OF COUNSELLING
Rationale for HIV Counselling:
arious studies throughout the world
suggest that HIV/AIDS counselling
assists people to make informed
decisions, cope better with their condition,
lead more positive lives, and prevent HIV
transmission. HIV/AIDS counselling is
important because infection with HIV is a
life long phenomenon and during the
course of the infection, a broad range of
physical, social and psychological needs
and problems are likely to be experienced.
The changing nature of the illness
imposes a variety of psychological and
emotional strains on individuals and those
closest to them.
HIV/AIDS counselling is a dialogue
between a client and a care provider
aimed at enabling the client to cope with
stress and to make personal decisions
related to HIV/AIDS. The counselling
process includes the evaluation of
personal risk of HIV transmission and the
facilitation of preventive behaviour.
HIV/AIDS counselling is a process that
begins with the client's first contact either
with an HIV/AIDS counselling service or
with the care system for HIV-related
needs. In the context of HIV/AIDS, the
care system includes all health and social
service facilities, both governmental and
non-governmental, where individuals
receive care and social support. The
counselling process continues through a
referral network to various community and
social support agencies, according to the
need of the individual and the family
affected by or worried about HIV.
Main goals of counselling are:
1. To provide psychosocial support to
those whose lives have been
affected by HIV
2 To prevent HIV infection and its
transmission to other people.
There are two major elements
of counselling for HIV/AIDS:
• The formation of sensitive, trusting
and respectful relationships; and
• A structured approach to ensure
the client has adequate knowledge
for problem-solving and decision
making in pre and post-test
counselling.
The overall purposes of HIV
counselling are:
• To provide clients with information
on HIV/AIDS (eg. means of
transmission, prevention, testing
etc),
• To help the infected individual,
family and friends to handle
possible emotional reactions to
HIV/AIDS (eg. grief, anger, fear,
denial).
• To discuss courses of action
adapted to client/family needs and
circumstances.
• To encourage change, when
needed, for the prevention or
control of infection (eg. through
protected or safer sex, and
changes to drug injecting
practices)
• To assess the risk of HIV
infection in potential blood and
organ donors.
Counselling helps people to define for
themselves the nature of the problems
they are facing. They can then make
realistic decisions about what they can do
to reduce the impact of these problems on
themselves, their family and friends.
Helping people to achieve the confidence
to make lifestyle changes is an integral
V
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 12
part of the counselling relationship.
Effective counselling should occur where
people most need it and should not be
restricted to a clinic or a structured doctorpatient
situation.
Who Should Become HIV
Counsellors?
A wide range of people can play a role in
the provision of HIV/AIDS counselling.
These people include:
• Doctors, nurses, community health
workers, social workers, and other
care-providers who have been
specially trained in HIV/AIDS
counselling. Some of these trained
individuals may also act as "focal
points" and educators for counselling
services in their province, district, or
community;
• Full-time counsellors (e.g.
psychologists, psychiatrists, and
therapists) who have been trained in
HIV/AIDS counselling, and who may
receive clients directly, or who may
receive clients through referral by
other care-providers;
• Religious leaders and other
community-based workers who work
consistently with people in
confidential situations and with
emotional concerns;
• Trained community members,
members of AIDS support groups,
and other people living with
HIV/AIDS.
The people who are respected by the
community, engender a sense of trust and
respect with the people with whom they
are working, and are willing to receive the
specialized counselling training are the
ideal selection to become HIV/AIDS
counsellors.
Who should receive HIV
Counselling?
HIV/AIDS counselling is for individuals,
couples, families and groups. In particular,
HIV counselling is for
• People who are worried about their
HIV status, and request testing for
HIV (pre-test, and post test
counselling);
• Those having HIV/AIDS in their
families;
• People experiencing difficulties with
issues such as stigma, isolation,
financial hardships, as a result of
HIV infection;
• Those seeking help because of past
or current risk behaviours; and
• Those wishing to donate blood or body
organs.
In Pakistan, where couples are
monogamous, with no extra marital or pre
marital sexual contact, the risk of HIV is
negligible. However, any unprotected
sexual contact outside this monogamous
relationship carries a risk of HIV
transmission. In any society, a variety of
individuals and groups may be particularly
at risk for HIV transmission. Some of
these include:
• Men and women with multiple sex
partners practising unprotected
penetrative anal, vaginal and oral
sex, including female and male
commercial sex workers and their
clients;
• Injecting drug users who share
injecting equipment;
• Recipients of unsafe blood, blood
products and donated organs
People in certain occupations are known
to be at greater risk for HIV transmission
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 13
in Pakistan. These occupations include
long haul lorry drivers, men who are
working and are then deported from the
Middle East, and "singing and dancing"
girls (commercial sex workers).
Counselling is also needed for people who
are at risk for HIV infection, and who do
not know their HIV status. Some people
may already recognize that they are at
risk, while others will be unaware of the
risk involved in their behaviours.
Therefore, HIV education for the general
population is an important strategy.
Where Should HIV Counselling
Take Place?
HIV/AIDS counselling should take place
wherever people concerned about, or
living with HIV/AIDS live or are treated.
Such places might include community
health centres, rural health clinics, basic
health units, hospitals, STD clinics, mother
and child health clinics, reproductive
health clinics, blood donation sites,
antenatal and post partum clinics, schools,
mosques, outpatient clinics, and all health
outreach and community based
programmes. Even in countries like
Pakistan, where the incidence and
prevalence of HIV is still comparatively
low, counselling services should always
be available at sites where care is being
provided for HIV-positive people, voluntary
counselling and testing centres and other
sites where HIV tests are done and results
can be traced to the individual, such as
blood donation sites. Each site will
influence how the counselling will be
conducted and will require different
responses from the counsellor. For
example, it is much easier to counsel
effectively when a private room is
available, instead of trying to discuss
sensitive matters in a busy and crowded
clinic
Confidentiality and Informed
Consent
HIV/AIDS counselling sessions are
confidential and most involve the
participation of a single client and a single
care-provider. The client has an absolute
right to confidentiality and/or anonymity
unless and until the client decides
otherwise. However, at the discretion of
the client and the care-provider, the
following people may also be involved in
HIV/AIDS counselling sessions:
• Members of the client's family;
• A second care-provider with
additional counselling skills that may
be required to help the client
address a particular problem or
sensitive issue;
• Members of a support group of
individuals affected by or infected
with HIV/AIDS;
• Other resource persons such as
clinicians and other health and social
service providers.
Although confidentiality is essential, it is
important to encourage the client to share
his/her test result with other supportive
people. Research and experience has
shown that people who share their
diagnosis with others live a better quality
of life, live longer, and experience a more
peaceful death. However, because
HIV/AIDS is surrounded by fear, stigma
and isolation, people tend to fear
disclosure of their condition. With support
from the counsellor, and careful
consideration of those who will share the
client's confidence, the benefits of shared
confidentiality far outweigh the risks.
To ensure confidentiality of client's
records, the client's initials and date of
birth can be the only identifying feature on
the record. A second list containing
information relating to the client can be
kept in a separate place. This second list
will contain tracing information to the
initialled record. Only those care providers
who are working directly with the client
should have access to this second list.
Informed consent implies that the client
fully understands the test that will be
performed and the possible consequences
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 14
of the test result (either positive or
negative). This informed consent also
involves the client's awareness of the
window period, where the client may be
infected, but still undetectable on testing
(see Appendix A for a sample informed
consent form).
In Pakistan, informed consent is implied
when pretest counselling is completed and
the client requested for the HIV test.
However, it should be noted that the client
may undergo HIV testing without pre-test
counselling, but whenever possible, pretest
counselling should be encouraged
and undertaken.

BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE HIV
COUNSELLING
IV/AIDS is a condition that often generates
fear, misunderstanding and
discrimination. Misunderstandings are
created by inaccurate or insufficient knowledge
related to HIV and fear of contracting the
disease. This discrimination and isolation can
be exacerbated by emotional, cultural, sexual and
religious influences.
Counsellors and other care-providers are not
immune to acts of discrimination, and
marginalisation of people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLHA). This discrimination might arise from fear
on contracting HIV while providing physical care
for the PLHA (universal precautions must always
be maintained). In addition, many care providers
find it difficult to openly discuss sexual practices
and preferences, sexual desires, and the number
and type of sexual partners. There is often a
"cloak of silence" related sexual practices and to
illicit drug use. This is particularly relevant if these
practices appear to by against the culture,
traditions, laws and religions of Pakistan.
Traditionally women cannot discuss sexual
practices with men, or men with women.
Consequently, care must be taken to select men
to counsel men and women to counsel women.
Intravenous drug use is another topic that many
care-providers find difficult to discuss. In Pakistan
the use of condoms as a method of birth control
(as well as control of HIV transmission) is not
openly discussed. In conclusion, experiences of
fear, stigma, isolation, discrimination and
marginalisation related to HIV/AIDS come from:
• Misinformation about HIV transmission
• Fear of contracting HIV
• Cultural influences related to sexuality and
birth control
• Cultural norms of silence regarding sexual
practices, preferences and desires.
• Legal issues related to the misuse of legal
and illegal substances, particularly
intravenous drug use (IVDU).
Negative attitudes, beliefs and values, or
misinformation about HIV significantly affect the
counsellor's ability to provide effective, respectful
and dignified care. Some documented behaviours
of care-providers include:
• Condemning the PLHA (i.e, considering
the PLHA is a bad person);
• Isolating/avoiding the PLHA because of
embarrassment of not knowing how to
handle the situation;
• Refusing to treat/care for the PLHA or
their families
• The inability to discuss sexual practices,
preferences and desires because of
embarrassment;
• Ignoring or avoiding discussion and
counselling about risk behaviours and HIV
prevention and care;
• Inability or unwillingness to approach the
PLHA and family in a non-judgmental,
caring and supportive manner.
Strategies to Confront Biases,
Beliefs, Values and Assumptions
Self-Awareness: Counsellors must examine their
own beliefs, values, assumptions and attitudes
toward HIV/AIDS. There has been considerable
evidence to suggest that care-providers are some
of the worst offenders in discriminating against,
and refusing to care for PLHA. Such practice is
unacceptable, however, change will only come
about if counsellors explore and challenge their
negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours. This
can
H
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 16
be done individually or through peer group
support where feelings and attitudes can be
discussed, explored and challenged. Counsellors
do not have to like all their clients but should be
keenly aware of how their feelings, attitudes and
prejudices can negatively affect the counselling
relationship. If a serious conflict arises, the client
should, if possible, be transferred to another
counsellor. In order to examine their own needs
and motivations, counsellors should ask
themselves the following questions:
• What are my own feelings about people
with HIV/AIDS?
• What are my feelings about people whose
behaviour has placed others (or
themselves) at risk of infection?
• Are there some kinds of people or types of
behaviour of which I disapprove so
strongly that I probably could not counsel
them non-judgementally?
• Am I trying to impose my own values on
my clients? How much do I want to
influence and control them?
• To what extent am I willing to let clients do
what they decide to do and take
responsibility for their own lives?
Education: The irrational and often exaggerated
perceptions of fear associated with HIV/AIDS
could be addressed through educational
programmes based on sound medical, social and
psychological knowledge. To be successful,
educational programmes should be sustained
over a period of time and not be episodic or
developed in isolation. Knowledge about
HIV/AIDS is constantly changing and counsellors
must be updated through continuing education
programmes. Counsellors can make an important
contribution to educating others.
Prevention: Prevention strategies will continue to
be compromised if fear, ignorance, intolerance,
and discrimination against HIV infected persons
persists. Where cultural norms and traditions
conflict with HIV prevention and education
strategies, these norms and traditions must be
challenged.
Care: Effective and dignified care can only be
provided where respect and compassion for
others is the norm. Looking inward to examine
and challenge the counsellor's beliefs, values,
assumptions and attitudes will go a long way to
providing compassionate and respectful care.
Such care can then be role modelled to others.
Care provided with both knowledge and
compassion can mean the difference between
misery and isolation and the provision of comfort,
with the preservation of dignity and respect.
Culture and Tradition
Encouraging and motivating clients to make
decisions about changing their risk behaviours or
lifestyles are important counselling strategies.
Clients are more likely to make behavioural
changes if the counsellor appreciates the cultural
or traditional importance of the behaviour.
"Culture" can be defined as the habits,
expectations, behaviours, rituals, values and
beliefs that people develop over time. In this
sense, culture is a product of the interaction
between people, ideas and the physical
environment. Through culture and tradition,
people learn acceptable behaviour, and what is
considered right and wrong.
Culture strongly influences people's feeling and
beliefs about health and illness, about caring for
the sick and about death and loss. Traditions
handed down from one generation to another
may be particularly important during times of
stress, especially illness and death. One culture
may see HIV/AIDS as a punishment while
another culture may see it as fate. Therefore,
culture and tradition will influence how people
interpret, explain and respond to HIV/AIDS.
Within Pakistan there will be variations on these
cultural beliefs.
It is important for the counsellor to examine
his/her own cultural beliefs and values and to
assess whether they are likely to be consistent
with or opposed to the people they will counsel. If
their cultural norms and traditions contradict, the
counsellor must question whether he/she is able
to transcend these cultural and traditional values
to help the client. For example, the counsellor
should question:
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 17
• Can I openly discuss issues of
heterosexuality, homosexuality, and
bisexuality?
• Can I counsel a commercial sex worker
without prejudice?
• Can I discuss and demonstrate condom
use?
• Can I counsel transvestites and other
trans-sexual people?
• Can I counsel injecting drug users?
It should be noted that some cultural norms and
practices should also be honoured. For example,
it would be advisable for women to counsel
women, and for men to counsel men. Also, if
people feel they cannot overcome some of the
issues raised in the above questions, they should
feel comfortable to make this known to others.
Other counsellors can then be asked to work with
clients with particular risk behaviours.
Within Pakistan, there will be differing cultural
beliefs and values. To gain a better
understanding of the issues related to illness, HIV
infection and counselling, the following questions
can be asked:
• What do people believe causes illness,
and how do they explain illness and
death?
• What do people call HIV/AIDS (slang) and
what do they believe causes it?
• What do people think about HIV-infected
people? Are they blamed for their illness?
If so, would they be abandoned?
• Who are recognised as helpers and
healers? What types of treatment do they
provide?
• What role do religious leaders play for
people with HIV/AIDS?
• What is expected of people with regard to
caring for the sick? Is the family expected
to provide care?
• How do people feel about discussing
condom use and other safer sex methods
with their sexual partners?
The counsellor should anticipate that some
information and discussions might be met with
embarrassment, laughter or anger and denial
depending on the person and the cultural context.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 18
PSYCHOSOCIAL
ASPECTS OF HIV
COUNSELLING
A psychosocial perspective is fundamental to
HIV/AIDS counselling. This psychosocial
perspective sees the client in the context of
his/her social environment. The counsellor should
recognize that personality traits, as well as the
social environment will influence the client's
behaviour. Therefore, central goal of counselling
is to restore or maintain the client's relationships
with family, friends and the community. This may
involve working through the anxieties that the
family and friends of the infected person may
have regarding their own health or future. In
addition, physical contact with the infected person
should be encouraged as an important way of
overcoming isolation.
Psychological Stress of HIV/AIDS
A diagnosis of HIV infection will create
considerable psychological stress. The conditions
that most people experience are uncertainty and
adjustment. The news of HIV infection creates
uncertainty about all aspects of the person's life,
including the quality and length of life, the effect
of opportunistic infections and the response of
society to the illness. These issues need to be
discussed openly and frankly. The person
diagnosed with HIV must also make a variety of
adjustments. There is no way of predicting how a
person will react to the news of a positive test
result, however, the following responses are
some of the possible reactions that must be
attended to in counselling.
Shock:
Shock is a normal response to life-threatening
news. Common shock reactions include:
• Numbness, "stunned" silence or disbelief
• Confusions, distractibility or uncertainty
about present and future circumstances.
• Despair
Emotional instability (eg. moving quickly and
unpredictably from tears to laughter and visa
versa).
Withdrawal, distancing from present issues and
circumstances, reluctance to become involved in
conversation or counselling, or activities and
plans for treatment or for the future.
Counselling Strategies:
Although shock is a normal response to hearing
the news of a life-threatening illness, it is
important to explore the feelings the client has
related to shock. As these feelings are aired, it is
more likely that the effects of shock will diminish.
Denial:
Some people respond to the news of their
infection or disease by denying it. While initial
denial can help reduce stress, if it persists, it can
prevent appropriate changes in behaviour and
adjustments in life, necessary to cope with HIV
and to prevent transmission. If denial is not
challenged, people may not accept the social
responsibilities that go with being infected.
Counselling Strategies:
The counsellor must broach this issue and
challenge the client about his/her denial. This
should be done in a supportive manner, however,
such topic must be brought into the open. Often
challenging the client about his/her denial will
provide an opportunity to break through this
impasse.
Anger
Some people become angry about the test result.
They may engage in destructive behaviour such
as harming themselves or others. With
progressing illness, the person may become unfit
for work. Boredom, with a life that is increasingly
restricted in diet, activity and social contacts may
be a source of anger. Anger can be expressed as
irritability or unprovoked outbursts, sometimes
triggered by seemingly trivial issues. Anger can
also be directed inwards in the form of self-blame
and self-destructive behaviours.
Counselling Strategies:
The counsellor should share his/her hunches
about the feelings of anger expressed verbally or
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 19
non-verbally by the client. With this opening, the
client can more freely explore and examine his
feelings. As these feelings are discussed openly,
the client is more able to confront his/her feelings
and deal with them appropriately.
Fear
People diagnosed with HIV infection have many
fears. The fear of death or of dying alone is very
common. Other common fears may include fear
of desertion, refection, leaving children/family
uncared for, disability, loss of bodily or mental
functions, and loss of confidentiality of privacy.
Fear may also be based on the experiences of
others or from lack of accurate, understandable
HIV/AIDS information.
Counselling Strategies:
If the counsellor suspects that the client is feeling
fearful, he/she must explore these feelings with
the client. As the client explores the experience of
fear, he/she is more able to face this fear in a
healthy way.
Isolation
The HIV-infected person may react by
withdrawing from all social contacts. A significant
factor is the fear of being abandoned, with the
consequent reaction; "everyone is going to
abandon me, so I will turn away first".
Counselling Strategies:
Initially, the counsellor should respect the need
for isolation, while continuing a supportive
counselling relationship. If isolation continues for
a long period, the counsellor should explore the
causes and support a change in attitude and
behaviour. Evidence has shown that social
support helps improve the client's quality of life,
prolong life and promote a peaceful death.
Loss
People with HIV/AIDS experience feelings of loss
about their ambitions, their physical
attractiveness, potency, sexual relationships,
status in the community, finances, stability and
independence. As the need for physical care
increases, there will also be a loss of privacy and
control over life. Loss of self-confidence is critical
since it can undermine the individual's ability to
cope with HIV/AIDS. Many will have to face their
own physical vulnerability and mortality. Also
many of these experiences cannot be avoided,
effective counselling will alleviate much of the
significant stress caused by these losses
Counselling Strategies:
The client should be encouraged to explore
his/her feelings of loss. In follow-up counselling
session, these feelings should be revisited as
situations and experiences may change. As
clients face the many losses they experience,
they are better able to cope and adjust to their
loss. In addition, with exploration of certain
losses, these experiences can be reverted. For
example, exploring the loss of sexual
relationships can lead to discussion about other
forms of sexual expression.
Grief
People with HIV/AIDS often have deep feelings of
grief over the losses they had experienced, or
had anticipated for the future. They may also
sense the grief of close family members and
others who care for them and witness their
declining health. In addition, family members
themselves grieve the declining health and
eventual death of a loved one.
Counselling Strategies:
Counsellors must be aware of these feelings of
grief for both the client and the family members
and help them explore these feelings. The
purpose of such counselling is to explore the
feelings associated with grief, and help the client
and family members experience grief in a more
manageable way. Anticipatory grief management
is also helpful. This can be accomplished by
sensitively approaching the subject of loss and
death and helping the client (individual and
family) explore how they will manage this grieving
process.
Guilt
When HIV infection is diagnosed, there is
usually a feeling of guilt about the possibility
of having infected others (especially spouses
and children), or about the behaviour that
may have resulted in the HIV infection (eg,
unsafe sexual experiences or injecting drug
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 20
use). There is also guilt about the sadness;
disruption and loss that the illness will cause
loved ones. Counsellors must help the client
fully explore feelings of guilt. If these feelings
are not fully examined, there is a tendency for
them to magnify as the illness progresses.
Unresolved guilt will cause the client to
become sicker more quickly and might result
in premature death.
Counselling Strategies:
The counsellor should not assume to know if
the client is experiencing guilt, or what the
client might feel guilty about. However, it is
appropriate for the counsellor to say; "many
people feel guilty when they realise they are
HIV infected, is this something you are
feeling?" In this way, the subject can be
approached, but the client is given the
opportunity to explore this feeling for
him/herself.
Depression
Depression may arise from the realization
that the virus infected the body, without any
hope for a cure, which often results in
feelings of powerlessness. A client may also
become depressed by loss of personal
control that may be associated with repeated
medical examinations. Similarly, experiencing
such things as the loss of potential for
procreating or parenting and for long-term
planning may contribute to depression.
Counselling Strategies:
Depression manifests itself in different ways.
The person may become quiet or withdrawn.
Anger, irritability or sudden outbursts might
also be signs of depression. The client may
also verbalise their feelings of depression. If
the counselor suspects that the client is
depressed, it is important to share that
suspicion with the client so that full
exploration of his/her feelings can take place.
As the feelings of depression are verbalized,
they become more accessible to the client
and this will help the client to cope and to
manage his/her feelings.
Anxiety
Anxiety can quickly become a prevailing
feeling for the person living with HIV/AIDS.
This anxiety often stems from chronic
uncertainty about their illness and its
progression. In addition, the client often
experiences declining ability to function
efficiently and loss of physical and financial
independence.
Counselling Strategies:
The client usually manifests signs of anxiety
that the counsellor can then address openly.
If these anxieties are masked, then the
counsellor can suggest; "many people
experience feelings of anxiety about how their
illness will progress and what that will mean
for the person's life and financial security.
"Have you experienced feeling anxious about
your condition and your future? In this way,
the feelings can be explored and anticipated.
This anticipatory guidance often helps the
client cope better as the illness progresses.
Loss of Self-esteem
Self-esteem is often threatened as soon as
HIV is diagnosed. Rejection by neighbors, coworkers,
acquaintances, and loved ones can
cause loss of social status and confidence,
leading to feelings of reduced self-worth. The
physical impact of HIV-related diseases that
bring, for example, facial disfigurement,
unsightly tumours, physical wasting, loss of
physical strength or bodily control can
compound the problem.
Counselling Strategies:
The counsellor should raise these issues with
the client. Ignoring physical changes will
impede effective counselling. Addressing
these issues and exploring how the client is
feeling about their condition will help them
cope with their changing condition.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 21
Suicidal thoughts, plans and actions
People who learn that they are HIV-infected
have a significantly increased risk of thinking,
planning and attempting or committing
suicide. Suicide may be seen as a way of
avoiding their own pain or of lessening that of
loved ones. Suicide may be active (deliberate
self-injury resulting in death) or passive (selfdestructive
behaviour such as concealing the
onset of a possibly fatal complication from an
opportunistic infection).
Counselling Strategies:
The counsellor must assess whether the client
has suicidal tendencies and approach this topic
with sensitivity and clarity. The counsellor must
also try to assess the gravity of the situation i.e.
whether the individual is in thought phase
(thinking about committing suicide), planning
phase (thinking how to commit suicide) or is in the
action phase. It is imperative to engage in open
discussion on this topic. Often talking through
these feelings will help alleviate these suicidal
thoughts and actions. Counselling strategies must
be planned considering the stage client is in.
Hypochondria
Excessive preoccupation with health or even the
smallest physical changes can lead to
hypochondria. This may be temporarily following
the diagnosis, or it may persist where adjustment
to the disease is difficult.
Counselling Strategies:
The counsellor should sensitively address the
client's preoccupation with his/her own illness and
concerns. It should be noted that some
preoccupation is normal and so this topic should
be addressed only if the client appears to be
overly absorbed in his/her own condition. It is
better to hold this hunch in check and only broach
the subject if the client persists in this selfpreoccupation,
to the detriment of other people in
his/her life or to his/her own well-being.
Spiritual Concerns:
The fear of death or other common reactions to
an incurable illness may create or increase the
individuals interest in spiritual matters.
Expressions of sin, guilt, forgiveness,
reconciliation, and acceptance may appear.
Counselling Strategies:
The counsellor should approach this subject, if
the client does not do so for him/herself. Referral
to a spiritual leader might be an important
strategy.
Additional Complications
Factors affecting the severity of the
client's psychological state might be also include:
• The person's physical condition;
• How well prepared the person is for the
news of HIV infection;
• How well the person is supported by
his/her family and in the community and
how readily he/she can call on the
assistance of family and friends;
• The person's prior personality and
psychological condition; and
• The cultural and spiritual values of the
person, his/her beliefs and values about
HIV/AIDS and his/her attitude towards
death.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 22
COUNSELLING SKILLS AND
RESOURCES
ounselling is a complex and active
process, and can be learned only through
practice and dynamic interaction. The
process of learning counselling skills requires
constant practice and feedback from trainers or
peers. Counselling differs from conversation in
the following ways:
• it is purposeful: every counselling session
has a particular aim that is achievable;
• specific: the counselling session deals
with a specific concern or issue; and is
• focused toward a desired goal.
Accordingly, counselling aims to:
• clarify the problems presented by the
client;
• provide necessary information;
• explore alternative options and resources;
• enable selection of realistic alternatives;
and
• stimulate motivation toward effective
problem solving and decision making.
Common features and requirements of effective
counselling include:
• Time: it is essential to provide enough time for
the effective counselling to take place. Also, it
takes time to develop trust in the relationship.
However, in many work situations, it is very
difficult to make time to complete a whole
counselling session. In this case, it should be
noted that effective interpersonal communication
can occur in a very limited amount of time. That
is, effective communication can often occur in a
brief encounter. Some people may require many
counselling sessions in order to explore their
problems, acknowledge the need to change a
particular behaviour, to learn protective methods,
begin to effectively solve problem and learn some
necessary negotiating skills.
Acceptance and Respect: people with HIV/AIDS
should feel that they are fully accepted by the
counsellor. The counsellor must be self aware
and non-judgemental in the counselling session.
Consistency and accuracy: any
information provided in the counselling session
must be consistent over time. The counsellor
therefore, needs to have a full knowledge of the
facts related to HIV/AIDS, or have the ability to
seek out the knowledge that he/she lacks.
HIV/AIDS information is changing rapidly, and the
counsellor must keep up with this knowledge
development.
Confidentiality: trust is one of the most important
factors in the relationship between the counsellor
and the client. It enhances the opportunity for
deep exploration of the client's condition and
improves the chances that the client will act
decisively on the information provided.
Confidentiality ensures that any reference to or
discussion about a client (except within a
professional relationship) will not be undertaken
without the express consent of the client.
Sensitivity and tactfulness: although it is
essential to raise issues related to sexuality
and/or drug use, such discussions should be
undertaken with sensitivity to the client's concern
and presenting problem. These sensitive topics
should be directed toward helping the client
explore emotional issues, solve important
concerns and make healthy decisions.

Counselling for HIV/AIDS 23
Stages in the Counselling Relationship
Each counselling session should be structured
around a beginning, middle and end. In some
circumstances, there might only be an opportunity
for one counselling session. However, whenever
possible, follow-up counselling sessions should
be planned. The stages of each counselling
session should include:
Beginning Stage: The beginning of the
counselling session is very important as it
provides an opportunity to establish a respectful,
trusting relationship. Confidentiality should be
discussed at this stage. Allow time for the client to
tell his/her story. This story telling might appear
disjointed, however, providing time to let the client
express him/herself is very important. At this
stage, do not interrupt the client except to
summarize or paraphrase certain issues. The
most important counselling strategy in the early
stages is to listen attentively. In follow up
counselling sessions, a recap of the activities that
the client has undertaken or an exploration of the
issues and problems he/she has faced since the
previous session should be explored.
Middle Stage: Once the client begins to trust the
counsellor and the initial story has been told,
open-ended questions can now be raised and a
case history taken. At this stage a plan of action
is put in place. One of the most difficult and
critical tasks is to encourage the client to share
his/her condition with a spouse, partner, or family
and friends. In addition, the counsellor should, (a)
support the continuing expression and discussion
of feelings, (b) if necessary, refer to available
formal and informal resources, (c) monitor
progress and modify plans as necessary, (d)
promote the continuation of changes in behaviour
and (e) help the person to move towards
acceptance and control
End Stage: Each counselling session should be
brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The client
should be aware of the progress he/she is making
and have plans for further behavioural change.
This strategy provides a sense of completion to
the counselling session with a planned movement
forward. When the counselling sessions are to be
completed, this final stage should be carefully
planned. The counsellor may increase the interval
between visits so as to let the client gain
increased independence with the knowledge that
the counsellor is still available if necessary. The
counsellor should end the counselling sessions
only when it is certain that the client can cope and
adequately plan for day-to-day functioning and
has a support system (eg. family, friends, support
group etc) in place. Finally, the counsellor should
support the maintenance of behavioural change
and make sure that all needed and available
resources have been identified and are being
used. It is important to provide an opportunity for
the client to re-enter counselling if it is deemed
necessary.
Effective Interpersonal Communication Skills
Counselling involves communication about
sensitive issues and requires deep exploration of
the client's issues and concerns. For this reason,
the counsellor should develop the following
interpersonal communication skills:
• Active Listening: The counsellor
indicates be words, expression and
gesture that he/she understands what the
client is saying. Such skill as nodding and
reflecting back what the client has said are
important.
• Encouraging: Some people do not
express their feelings openly, even though
they may feel them deeply. The counsellor
should encourage the expression of
feelings. It is only when people work
through their feelings that they can begin
constructive change. Words like, "yesplease
continue" can be very encouraging.
• Recognising: The counsellor should be
skilled in recognising and distinguishing
various emotions the client is
experiencing. Statements such as "that
must be very difficult to accept"
demonstrate the counsellor's ability to
recognise particularly difficult issues.
• Acknowledging: The counsellor should
acknowledge feelings such as anger,
sadness and fear in a direct, unemotional
way. Statements such as "I understand
that this is not easy for you" are helpful.
• Effective Questioning: Counsellors use
questions to help clients express their
feelings and problems. These questions
should be open-ended, aimed promoting
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 24
further exploration. Therefore, rarely are
closed questions that require only a "yes"
or "no" answer helpful. They should also
enable the client to give a variety of
answers "please tell me what you know
about...", or "how do you think your wife
will respond to this information?" are
exploratory open-ended questions.
• Empathising: Empathy is more than
sympathy; it involves trying to place
oneself in another person's situation. This
is a difficult skill to fully master as it
requires the counsellor to suspend their
own feelings and judgement and to enter
the experience of the other. This is not to
say that the counsellor looses his/herself
in the process, instead, it is a skill of
placing oneself into the "shoes" of
another, and reflecting on the events
experiences, emotions, and concerns. A
statement such as I can see you're feeling
very anxious about..." is an effective
empathic response. This response
captures the feeling of the client while
being specific about the reason the feeling
has occurred.
• Respecting: Counsellors should respect
clients' views and beliefs. They can show
this respect by asking a client to explain
unfamiliar aspects of their beliefs and
values. These beliefs and values might be
cultural, traditional or based on personal
experience. Statements such as, " I am
not familiar with this, can you tell me
more". Another way to show respect is to
listen attentively and paraphrase what is
heard.
• Clarifying: The counsellor tries to clarify
either what the client has said. For
example, "do you mean...?", or presenting
factual information. For example, "no, HIV
is not transmitted by touching the infected
person".
• Paraphrasing: Clients can tell when they
are being understood when the counsellor
repeats what the client has said, using
his/her own words. Statements such as,
"so you are saying that....". In this way, the
client can either agree with the
paraphrase, or clarify his/her statement.
• Challenging: The counsellor should
confront the client if he/she appears to be
avoiding important issues or when the
client has not followed through with an
agreed rather than one answer. For
example upon action plan. This
challenging can be sensitive so that the
client can see it as a positive act, and not
an expression of anger or blame. An
effective challenge might be, "last week
you said that you were going to talk to
your wife about your illness, what has got
in the way of you doing this?"
• Repeating: At times of stress and crisis,
people may not understand everything
they are told because they are in a state
of denial, or feel overwhelmed. The
counsellor should not hesitate to repeat
important information. In fact, most people
need to be told more than once, in order
for certain information to be fully
understood and retained.
• Emphasizing: Often people avoid
focusing on the real problem. The
counsellor should highlight the most
critical issues. For example "of all the
things we have covered today, the point
that stands out for me is...", or, "can I just
emphasize the following points...?" In this
way, the client has an opportunity to focus
on some important issues that have been
raised in the counselling session.
• Structuring: Structuring determines
which problems or issues need immediate
attention and those that can be postponed
to a latter session. It is an essential
planning and helps to structure the
ongoing counselling process. However, it
is important to note that the structuring
that occurs in one session might not be
appropriate in subsequent. Structuring
provides the counsellor and the client with
a sense of movement. Such statements
as, "there are three main issues we are
facing" help focus and structure the
session and subsequent sessions.
• Motivating: Counsellors should try to
motivate clients by offering positive
encouragement of new behaviours. For
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 25
example, the counsellor might explain how
the changed behaviours will help protect
the client's loved ones. This may be a
critical source of motivation. Another
source of motivation is to explore what
might happen if the client does not change
their risk behaviour. Anticipating potential
problems can be another source of
motivation. For example, "what do you
think might happen if you continue to have
sex with commercial sex workers?"
• Summarizing: This is very much like
paraphrasing in that it helps to ensure that
the client and the counsellor understand
one another correctly. Summarizing can
be done by the client or the counsellor. At
the end of the session, it might be
important to summarize the important
points that have been covered that
session. Such statements as, "To
summarize then, these are the issues..."
help focus and highlight the major issues
in the counselling session.
Common Errors in Counselling
The principles of effective counselling are easy to
read but difficult to apply. Continuous practice
with feedback is essential to fully incorporate
these skills into a helping relationship. Some
common counselling error include:
• Controlling the session rather than
encouraging the client's spontaneous
expression of feelings and need.
• Judging by showing non-verbal
disapproval or by making statements that
indicate that the client is not meeting the
counsellor's standards.
• Moralizing, preaching, and patronizing -
telling people how they out to behave or
lead their lives.
• Labelling, rather than trying to find out the
person's motivation, fears and anxieties.
• Unwarranted reassuring - trying to
induce undue optimism by making light of
the client's version of the problem.
• Not accepting the client's feelings -
saying they should feel differently.
• Advising before the client has enough
information or time to arrive at a personal
solution.
• Interrogating - using questions in an
accusatory way. "Why" questions often
sound accusatory.
• Encouraging dependence - increasing
the client's need for the counsellors
continuing presence and guidance.
• Cajoling - persuading the client to accept
new behaviour by flattery or deceit.
Non-verbal Communication
There is research evidence that suggests that
between 70-90% of all communication is nonverbal
This means that a counsellor must be very
self aware of his/her own beliefs and values and
how these might affect the counselling session. In
addition, counsellors should pay close attention to
both the verbal and non-verbal messages of the
client. The following table contrasts positive and
negative nonverbal counselling techniques:
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 26
Positive Negative
Looks the client in the eye
Uses attentive facial expression, body movement
and posture.
Sits a suitable distance from the client Does not
speak too quickly, or too slowly
Uses occasional gestures such as nods, to
acknowledge the client
If appropriate, uses humour to reduce the tension
Uses a tone of voice similar to the client's
Looks away frequently
Frowns, scowls or yawns
Sits at an inappropriate distance
Speaks too quickly, or too slowly
Appears un-reactive and fails to respond to the
client's words or gestures
Uses humour inappropriately, or conversely,
increases the tension by too heavy and serious a
tone
Uses an unpleasant tone of voice
Introducing Sensitive Topics
Talking about how HIV/AIDS is transmitted sexually or
through injecting drug use requires sensitivity on the
part of the counsellor. Introducing these sensitive
topics is essential, however, many counsellors find in
depth discussion on these topics fully to be
problematic. Information about intimate behaviour will
have to be gathered and interpreted. Some client
behaviours will be disapproved of by the general
population, and in some circumstances, even illegal.
The first, and most important task for the counsellor is
to examine his/her own abilities to discuss intimate and
often traditionally unsanctioned behaviours in an open,
non-judgemental manner. This can be challenging for
the counsellor. It is then the responsibility of the
counsellor to encourage open discussion with his/her
client. There is no simple formula for encouraging
people to talk about sensitive topics. Effective
discussion will depend in large measure on the ability
of the counsellor to:
• Counsel to the emotional and intellectual level
of the client;
• Provide an atmosphere where the client feels
safe and secure by establishing a supportive,
non-judgemental relationship; and
• Demonstrate his/her own ease in talking about
topics usually avoided in ordinary social life or
in medical consultations.
All HIV counselling will require skill, tact and sensitivity.
In some circumstances, the counsellor may
have to enquire about taboos or unusual practices.
The counsellor should also realize that the risk of HIV
infection may involve secret behaviours. In some
circumstances, the counsellor should understand and
be willing to use local or slang expressions.
Counselling regarding sensitive and deeply personal
topics requires the counsellor to:
• Feel secure and at ease when enquiring about
intimate matters that are rarely openly
discussed, to enable clients to talk about
sensitive topics;
• Focus the discussion on specific at risk
practices and behaviours. The detail needed
(eg. bisexuality, homosexuality, unprotected
heterosexuality with multiple partners, injecting
drug practices etc.) may embarrass the client,
and even the counsellor, in some instances,
however, such open discussion and
counselling is essential.
In order to counsel effectively, the counsellor
should ask him/herself the following questions:
• Which sexual practices will be most difficult for
me to talk about?
• What everyday words will clients use or avoid
when explaining risk practices or behaviours?
• How will I approach counselling with clients
who differ from me culturally, sexually, or of a
different age?
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 27
• How will I explain the need to
discuss intimate or taboo subjects?
Counselling Strategies: The first step is to be
self aware about the counsellor's beliefs, values,
assumptions and judgements about issues
related to HIV transmission. It is also imperative
that the client understands that confidentiality will
be maintained. Developing a trusting, respectful
relationship with the client before approaching
sensitive topics is essential. If time is limited,
opening to the exploration of sensitive topic must
be carried out, however, the counsellor must
continually reassure the client that confidentiality
will be maintained. Explain to the client that
preventing the spread of HIV requires open and
honest discussion about his/her life style and
sexual or drug related practices. Start the
counselling session by explaining to the client that
discussion of sensitive, perhaps embarrassing
subjects will be necessary. Be clear and open
about what issues need to be covered in the
counselling session. Be sure that the counsellor is
appropriate for the client. That is, usually a man
should counsel a man, and a woman should
counsel a woman. When group or family
counselling occurs, then a decision should be
made about the appropriate gender of the
counsellor. Often generalizing the practice to
other people will allow a person to talk more
freely at the beginning of the counselling session.
For example, the counsellor may say, "some
people around here say that you can only get HIV
if you have sex with many partners (eg. singing
and dancing girls). Have you heard this?"
Questions are also critical in counselling (see
Appendix B for examples of good HIV
questioning). Only through honest and open
dialogue can the counsellor illicit information
about risk, check the understanding, or
misunderstanding of facts and assist the client in
deciding about the courses of action. Such
questions might address relationships, the type of
sexual practices the client engages in and the
client's knowledge about HIV/AIDS including
modes of transmission. This topic will be covered
in more detail under the chapter on HIV
counselling.
Crisis Counselling
Crisis counselling is most often necessary when
the client perceives HIV/AIDS as a threat to
his/her survival and/or to the social stigma he/she
perceives to be associated with the news. The
crisis event usually has four stages. The first
stage is one of shock when the client realizes that
something is wrong, symptoms appear or when
the HIV test is positive (after a second confirming
test result). This event often leads the client to
recoil from the news (second stage). For
example, the client may struggle emotionally with
the full implications of the test result. Some clients
will demand another test at another testing facility
to confirm the diagnosis. Although these emotions
are normal, they should be transitory.
Some clients quickly begin to come to terms with
the diagnosis, while others withdraw (stage
three). At this stage, it is often appropriate to
allow the client time to explore their emotions of
fear, denial, shock etc. However, it is important
not to allow the client to stay withdrawn and
isolated from the counsellor or his/her family and
friends. Such behaviours often lead to depression
or denial of their condition. Such denial can be
dangerous, as the prevention of HIV transmission
often requires behavioural change (see Chapter 4
for details about how to counsel in these
circumstances). If counselling is effective, and the
client feels supported and understood, the client
may move to the fourth stage, one of acceptance
of his/her condition. This acceptance is the first
step in promoting necessary behavioural change.
An emotional crisis may result if a person feels:
• Intensely threatened;
• Completely surprised and caught unaware
by events that are happening;
• Emotionally disturbed as a result of loss of
control; and
• Emotionally paralysed because there does
not seem to be any solutions to the
problem, all efforts to resolve the situation
appear hopeless, or the results appear to
be overwhelming to the person.
Counselling Strategies: It should be noted that
any event that is perceived by the client to be a
crisis, should be treated as such by the
counsellor. In this sense, the counsellor should
begin by respecting and supporting the emotional
crisis as the client sees it. It is very important at
this stage not to "down play" the emotions of the
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 28
client or try to reason with him/her about the
nature of the situation. Some clients become so
anxious and overwhelmed that they cannot
function normally. At this stage, the counsellor
should actively listen to the client by responding
and paraphrasing (addressed earlier in the
chapter) his/her emotional concerns. When the
client is in crisis, the counsellor should remain
calm and accept the fear as genuine. The
following counselling techniques are effective in a
crisis:
• Guided/structured questioning: The
counsellor can help the client explore
his/her feelings by asking open-ended
questions. For example, "At this stage,
you are probably feeling very
overwhelmed. I need to ask you a few
questions to help us sort out what you are
feeling" (see Appendix B for some
examples of effective questions).
• Acceptance: Accepting the clients
feelings as valid is an important strategy.
For example, I can see that you are
feeling angry and questioning the result.
This must be very hard for you to accept
this diagnosis".
• Emotional support: As well as
acceptance, the counsellor should provide
emotional support to the client, while also
providing a sense of direction. Statements
such as, "Many people feel overwhelmed
with the news when they first hear it. I can
see that you are having some of these
feelings yourself. As time goes on, we will
be able to sort through these emotions
and help you move forward with your
future".
Some additional skills the counsellor can use in a
crisis situation are:
• Staying in the present by focusing on the
client's immediate expression of emotions;
• Checking whether the client shows the
ability to start making some important
decisions;
• Clarifying with the client what he/she
regards as a crisis, and supporting the
client to move toward reducing this
emotional burden;
• Starting to work with the client on aspects
of the crisis and to foster confidence that
he/she can deal with future problems.
In a crisis situation, the client is unlikely to
remember all that the counsellor tells him/her.
Depending on the literacy level of the client,
information should be written down and given to
the client (see Appendix F for some examples of
client information sheets). In addition, the
counsellor should be prepared to repeat
information, often many times, to ensure client
understanding.
Problem-solving Counselling
Often the client feels able to deal with the crisis
once some pressing problems have been
addressed and acceptable solutions found. This
strategy gives the client a feeling of self-efficacy.
However, crisis counselling deals with the
present, while problem-solving looks to the future.
Some of the most important problem-solving
techniques used by the counsellor involve mutual
problem posing and planning. This planning
should include how to prevent further HIV
transmission, ways of coping with the reaction to
HIV/AIDS, and seeking appropriate resources,
including medical care. The counsellor should
highlight the consequences of HIV infection and
suggest possible approaches to address these
problems. Once the client fully understands the
consequences of HIV, the client and the
counsellor can work together to assess how best
to address these concerns. Clients are more likely
to follow healthy decisions if they have taken part
in the problem-solving process.
Counselling Strategies: The problem-solving
approach is used to help clients to:
• Understand the nature of the illness;
• Think through the impact of the disease
on their daily living;
• Gain the courage and personal skills for
dealing with the problem; and
• Change behaviours to protect themselves
and others.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 29
Effective problem-solving counselling involves:
• Defining all aspects of the problem as the
client sees it;
• Encouraging open discussion about the
client's feelings, while demonstrating
support and reassurance that these
feelings are normal;
• Assessing the client's past and present
problem-solving abilities;
• Reducing the problem into a number of
manageable parts that can be more easily
addressed. As the problem is broken
down into manageable components, the
client and counsellor are able to begin
planning some problem-solving strategies;
• Discussing personal and other related
resources available to the client.
Decision-making Counselling
Based on the awareness of risk behaviour or a
diagnosis of infection, the client must make
decisions about behaviour and other possible
changes. Hopefully, these decisions will be made
with growing emotional control and better
understanding of the problem. Decision-making
counselling helps the client to focus on often
disturbing, but necessary decisions. Decisions
that may need to be taken into account include:
• Who will need to be told of the condition,
and how and when will they be told?
• How will the client handle certain legal,
financial or other matters?
• Who will be asked to provide emotional
support and physical care?
• Who will care for the children?
• What kind of change can be made in diet
or lifestyle in order to stay as healthy as
possible?
Counselling Strategies: As trust is established
between the counsellor and the client, addressing
these questions (and perhaps others) will be very
important. It will also be important for the
counsellor to judge when the client is ready to
begin this decision-making process. Only when
the time is right will the client be able to move
toward effective problem-solving and decisionmaking
(the issue of timing was discussed earlier
in this chapter). Consideration and ultimate
resolution to these questions will help the client
restore a sense of control and movement toward
necessary conclusions.
Developing Adequate Resource
Networks
As HIV infection progresses into AIDS, different
medical and psychosocial needs emerge. The
counsellor cannot (and should not) meet all these
needs. Instead, the counsellor should be fully
aware and refer the client to other available
formal or informal resources. Formal resources
include medical care services (eg. health centres,
clinics, hospitals etc.). Services that provide
assistance with finances, food, transportation,
other counsellors, and health care workers should
also be made available to the client. Informal
resources that include families and friends,
religious leaders, traditional healers, community
organizations and peer groups are also important.
The counsellor can also encourage the formation
of other resources and support where necessary.
Information about these resources should be
available to the client in the counselling session
as well as being available in other formal and
informal settings. The counsellor can help the
client negotiate these resources and sometimes
act as an advocate for the client. In addition, the
counsellor can also help support the treatments
and advice given from other resources. A key
task of the counsellor is to mobilize or create
additional resources for the HIV infected client.
Counsellors also need a referral system for
difficult cases. Links should be made with other
psychologists and psychiatrists for this purpose. It
is also very important that other formal and
informal services know about this HIV counselling
service. Information about this service should be
provided to all organizations, both formal and
informal, that care for someone living with
HIV/AIDS.
Self-help Peer Groups
Self-help peer support networks are a valuable
addition to counselling. The counsellor can refer
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 30
clients to these groups, if they exist, or they can
help facilitate the formation of such groups. These
support groups are often formed with the aid of
nongovernmental organizations. Such peer
support groups can help the client with issues
related to particular risk behaviours that need to
be changed. If peer support groups are not
available, with the permission of both parties, the
counsellor can introduce clients to one another, to
aid in their psychosocial support. Matters that can
be dealt with effectively through self-help peer
support groups include:
• Learning about living with HIV infection.
Self-help groups are often in a good
position to provide information and mutual
support,
• Helping care-givers and loved ones to
handle the pressures of day-to-day living
with sick or distressed people.
• Deciding how best to talk about HIV/AIDS
with family, friends and other people
who can provide support
• Peer support groups can organize
discussion and training about how to
adopt or maintain new risk reduction
behaviours.

CHAPTER 6:
VOLUNTARY COUNSELLING AND HIV
TESTING (VCT)
IV counselling is a confidential
dialogue between a client and counsellor
aimed at enabling the client to cope with
stress and take personal decisions related to
HIV/AIDS. The counselling process includes
evaluating the personal risk of HIV transmission
and discussing how to prevent infection. It
concentrates specifically on emotional and
social issues related to possible and
actual infection with HIV and AIDS. HIV
counselling has as its objectives both prevention
and care. It is important for counsellors to have a
basic understanding of the HIV antibody tests that
may be performed, as well as the necessity of
confirmatory HIV antibody testing. Figure 1
provides an overview of the HIV counselling
process.

SUMMARY
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 32
Antibody Testing
Any blood test used to detect HIV infection must
have a high degree of sensitivity (the probability
that the test will be positive if the patient is
infected) and specificity (the probability that the
test will be negative if the patient is uninfected).
No antibody test is ever 100 % sensitive and
specific Therefore, if available, all positive test
results should be confirmed by retesting,
preferably by a different test method. HIV
antibody tests usually become positive within 3
months of the individual being infected with the
virus (the window period). In some individuals, the
test may not be positive until 6 months or longer
(considered unusual). Tests for HIV detect the
presence of antibodies to HIV, not the virus itself.
The three main objectives for which HIV antibody
testing is performed are:
• screening of donated blood;
• epidemiological surveillance of HIV
prevalence;
• diagnosis of infection in individuals.
Screening of donated blood accounts for the
majority of HIV tests performed in Pakistan. It is a
highly cost effective preventive intervention as the
transmission of HIV through infected blood is at
least 95%.
HIV testing was initially used for clinical
confirmation of suspected HIV disease. More
recently, people have been encouraged to attend
voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services
to find out their HIV status. It is hoped that if
people know their HIV status and are seronegative,
they will adopt preventive measures to
prevent future infection. If the person is seropositive,
it is hoped that they will adopt risk
reduction behaviours, learn to live positively,
access care and support at an earlier stage, and
plan for their own and their family's future.
Antibody tests:
Traditionally, HIV testing has been done using
ELISA. However, there are various essential
requirements for ELISAs to be performed
accurately:
1. Laboratory equipment (eg. pipettes, microtitre
trays, incubators, washers, and
ELISA readers) must be available.
2. Constant supply of electricity and regular
maintenance of equipment.
3. Skilled technicians.
4. Accurate storage and testing
temperatures.
Recent advances in technology have lead to
various simple rapid tests being developed. Most
of these tests come in a kit and require no
reagent, equipment, training or specified
temperature controls. Single tests can be
performed at any time. These tests are as
accurate as ELISA and the results can be
received within hours. In Pakistan, the Rapid
Single Test method is most widely used, with
confirmation of an equivocal or sero-positive test
usually being performed with ELISA. One
advantage of the Single Rapid Test is that, in
some circumstances, the client can wait for the
result. It has been found that if the test result is
delayed, some clients do not return for their
result.
False positive result:
HIV tests have been developed to be especially
sensitive and consequently, a positive result will
sometimes be obtained even when there are no
HIV antibodies in the blood. This is known as a
false positive, and because of this, all positive
results must be confirmed by another test
method. A confirmed positive result means that
the individual is infected with HIV.
False negative result:
This situation occurs when the blood tested gives
a negative result for HIV antibodies when it
should really have been positive, as the person is
infected. The likelihood of a false negative test
result must be, discussed with patients if their
history suggests that they have engaged in
behaviour that are likely to put them at risk of HIV
infection. In this situation, repeated testing over
time may be necessary before they can be
reassured that they are not infected with HIV. The
most frequent reason that a false negative test
result has been obtained is that the individual is
newly infected (ie. the window period) and is not
yet producing HIV antibodies. However, it is
important to remember that someone who has
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 33
tested negative for HIV, can become infected the
following day.
Pre-test Counselling
Pre test counselling should focus on two main
topics: (a) the person's personal history of risk
behaviours or having been exposed to HIV, and
(b) assessment of the person's understanding of
HIV/AIDS (including modes of transmission), and
the person's previous experiences in crisis
situations. The aim of pre-test counselling is to
provide information about the technical aspects of
testing and the possible personal, medical, social,
psychological and legal implications of being
diagnosed as either HIV positive or negative.
Information should be up to date and given in a
manner that is easy to understand. Testing of
blood donors is different from testing of those
suspected of having HIV/AIDS, however, both
require enquiring about risk behaviours. Testing
should be discussed as a positive act that is
linked to changes in risk behaviour, coping and
increasing the quality of life.
Components of Pre-test
Counselling: (see Appendix C for counsellor pretest
checklist).
Assessment of risk: Assessing the likelihood
that the person has been exposed to HIV includes
considering:
• Frequency and type of sexual practices, in
particular, high risk practices such as
vaginal and anal intercourse without a
condom or unprotected sex with
commercial sex workers.
• Being part of a group with high-risk
prevalence for HIV infection (eg.
intravenous drug users, male and female
commercial sex workers and their clients,
prisoners, refugees, migrant workers, long
haul lorry drivers, homosexual and
bisexual men). In addition, health care
workers and carers are at risk for HIV
infection where the practice of universal
precautions is problematic.
• Having received a blood transfusion,
organ transplant, blood or blood products
where HIV screening has not occurred. It
should be noted that with even the most
sensitive screening measures, some HIV
infected blood may get into the general
system.
• Having been exposed to non-sterile
invasive procedures such as tattooing,
scarification, and male circumcision
Assessment of understanding: The
following questions should be asked in assessing
the need for HIV testing:
• Why is the test being requested?
• What are the behaviour patterns or
symptoms of concern?
• What does the person know about the test
and its uses?
• What are the person's beliefs and
knowledge about HIV transmission and its
relationship to at risk behaviours?
• Who could provide emotional and social
support (e.g. family, friends, etc)?
• Has the person sought VCT before, if so,
when, from whom, for what reason and
what was the result?
• Has the person considered what to do, or
how he/she would react if the result is
positive, or if it is negative?
• Table 1 provides a checklist of issues to
be discussed with the client in pre-test
counselling (see Appendix C for a pre-test
counselling checklist).
Preparation for HIV testing: Effective pre test
counselling will prepare the person for the test by:
• Discussing confidentiality and informed
consent for the HIV test;
• Explaining the implications of knowing one
is or is not infected;
• Exploring the implications for marriage,
pregnancy, finances, work, stigma etc;
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 34
• Facilitating discussion about ways to cope
with knowing one's HIV status (eg. has the
person considered what to do or how
she/he would react if the test is positive, or
if the test is negative?);
• Promoting discussion on sexuality and
sexual practices;
• Correcting myths, misinformations and
misunderstandings related to HIV/AIDS.
• Promoting discussion on relationships
especially the benefits of shared
confidentiality between the person and
his/her loved ones;
• Promoting discussion on sexual and drug
related risk behaviours (as appropriate);
• Exploring emotional coping mechanisms
and the availability of social support;
• Explaining how to prevent HIV
transmission;
HIV counselling helps the person make informed
choices. However, it is important to note that
people who do not want pre-test counselling
before taking the HIV test should not be required
to do so. In addition, a decision to be tested
should be an informed decision. Informed consent
implies awareness of the possible implications of
a test result (including the window period). Figure
2 provides a framework for pre and post-test
counselling.

Counselling for HIV/AIDS 37
Benefits of pre-test counselling: Access to pretest
counselling is not always available and some
people might refuse this option. However, if the
test is positive, there are considerable benefits to
providing this service which include:
• Improved acceptance of HIV status and
ability to cope.
• Empowerment, including greater
involvement of the PLA in their care.
• Facilitation of behavioural change.
• Reducing the risk of mother-child
transmission.
• Early management of opportunistic
infections, contraceptive advice and other
information and education.
• Provision of early social and peer support.
• Normalizing and de-stigmatising
HIV/AIDS.
• Instilling hope and addressing the quality
of life issues for the PLA.
• Planning for future care, making a will and
considerations for future childcare.
Figure 2 provides a flow chart of the pre-test and
post-test counselling process.
Post-test Counselling
The counselling session should begin by trying to
put the person at ease. If possible, the room
should be quiet, without the fear of being
disturbed. Arrange the chairs so that bright light
will not shine in anyone's eyes. The counsellor
should then tell the person the test result in a
clear and direct manner. The result (either
positive or negative) should then be discussed,
including how the person feels about the result.
Providing further information might be necessary
although the person may be shocked (no matter
what the result), and may not fully take in all the
information. However, in some circumstances,
this might be the only chance to counsel this
person and so asking them to repeat the
information, or have some basic facts written
down will be helpful (see Appendix F for basic
client information sheets). It is important for the
person to have time to reflect on the result and
understand the next course of action. Ideally,
couple and/or family counselling should be
started and further counselling follow-up
arranged.
HIV-positive Test Result Counselling
(The positive test result will only be given after the
second HIV test confirms a positive result.) The
counsellor should tell the person as gently as
possible, providing emotional support and
discussing how best to cope with the result. This
is not the time for speculation, but time to give
clear, factual explanations of what the news
means. Assess the emotional impact of the news
and validate the person's reactions as normal.
Fear of dying, job loss, family acceptance,
concern about the quality of life, the effects of
treatment and response by society might be
explored (see psychosocial aspects of HIV
counselling Chapter 4 of these guidelines). If
there is a concern that the person might not
return for follow up counselling, then information
about relevant related services might be included,
such medical treatment for opportunistic
infections, social services for financial and
ongoing psychosocial support etc (see section on
resource networks in Chapter 5 of these
guidelines). However, if follow up counselling is
an option, then it would be advisable to leave this
information to a later date when the person is
more able to absorb the details and explore some
options. Assess the person's understanding and
ability to use preventive methods. Free condoms
can be given out during this session together with
advice on how to use them and where to get
more. Figure 3 provides a flow chart of the
counselling process after a positive result, table 2

client and Appendix D provides a counsellor

Figure 3: HIV COUNSELLING POSITIVE TEST RESULT
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 40
Counseling Table- Equivocal
Result
How news of HIV infection is accepted or
incorporated often depends on the following:
• The person's physical health.
People who are ill often have a
delayed response and can only
absorb information when they
grow stronger
• How well the person has been
prepared for the news.
• How well supported the person
is, both in the community and
by family and friends.
• The pre-test psychological
condition of the person. Where
psychological distress existed
before the result, learning of
the result could make this
distress greater.
• The cultural and spiritual
values attached to AIDS,
illness and death. In some
communities people might take
a fatalistic attitude, whereas in
other communities, AIDS is
sometimes seen as evidence
of antisocial or blasphemous
behaviour.
Counselling and support may need to address
feelings of shock, fear, loss, grief, guilt,
depression, anxiety, denial, anger, suicidal
activity or thinking, reduced self esteem and
spiritual concerns etc. In addition, social issues
such as loss of income, discrimination, social
stigma, relationship changes and changing
requirements for sexual expression might need to
be explored. These issues have all been
addressed at length in the chapter, Psychosocial
and Cultural Aspects of Counselling"
Another important consideration is contact
tracing. HIV infection can only be controlled when
every effort is made to contact, test, and possibly
treat the contacts. Contact tracing is a laborious
task and often problematic. First the client should
be assured that their name or other identifying
properties would not be revealed to the contacts.
Also, the client should be given the option of
contacting the HIV-infected contacts him/herself.
The counselor must stress the importance of this
contact tracing to the client in order to control
further spread of HIV. Appendix E contains a
sample partner notification form.
HlV- negative Test Result
Counselling
If the HIV test is negative, then counselling about
at risk behaviours and methods of prevention are
vitally important. Also, the counsellor must explain
about the "window period" (between 3-6 months)
when a negative result may be a false negative, if
there is concern about the HIV status of the
person, counsel them to return for a repeat test in
3-6 months. Ensure protection in the meanwhile,
explaining that the client could become infected at
any time. This is an ideal time to discuss sexual
practices and preferences and potential drug
abuse (particularly intravenous drug use) and
other at risk behaviours. The person will probably
be more open to learning about safe sex
practices and modifying risk behaviours and be
willing to consider necessary behaviour changes.
Free condoms can be given out during this
session together with advice on how to use them
and where to get more when needed.

process for a negative test result, and Table 3
contains the issues that should be discussed in

Counselling After an Equivocal Test
or Positive First Test when a
Second (confirmatory) Test Should
be Performed
There are times when a test is unequivocal
(uncertain) and a second test must be carried out.
Also, if the first HIV test is positive, a second,
different test should be performed to confirm (or
not) the initial test. Counselling in such
circumstances will be slightly different from the
counselling for a positive or negative test result.
First, the client must be told the news of the
uncertain test result. It is usual practice to explain
to the client that the first test is inconclusive, and
a second (different) test should be performed.
See figure 5 for the decision flow of counselling
for this equivocal result. Counselling should then
follow the same guidelines as those for a negative
test result (see the previous guidelines for
counselling of HlV-negative test results).
Continued Counselling and Support
The HIV-infected person and his/her family might
require further counselling and support. Such
care helps improve their quality of life as well as
enhancing their ability to cope and make informed
decisions about ongoing care. Counselling and
support might include encouraging the PLA to join
a peer support group where psychosocial and
instrumental support as well as education and
treatment options may be addressed (see the
guidelines for Self-help Peer Groups in the
Chapter 5, Counselling Skills and Resources).
Where services exist, further individual/family
counselling might also be beneficial. In addition,
referral to other agencies, organizations and
services will be beneficial (see Developing
Adequate Resource Network guidelines in
chapter 5, Counselling Skills and Resources).
POST-TEST Table 3: COUNSELING CHEKLIST - NEGATIVE RESULT
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 43
(Requesting client take a second test)
Pre-Test Counseling: Discuss confidentiality; explain that the test result is inconclusive, and a second test
should be taken (using another test method) to ensure accuracy of the result; assess current at risk
behaviours; or support the behaviour changes the client has made; examine the client's psychosocial
condition, and social support; provide oral or factual information on HIV/AIDS; provide anticipatory guidance
about how the person might respond to the result of the test (either positive or negative)
Provide time for the person to consider whether to take the second test or not
Obtain informed consent and blood test taken
Post-Test Counseling: Depending upon the result of the second test, follow the guidelines outlined for
post-test counseling for positive or negative test results
Bereavement Counselling
Families and friends often have little social
support, or may have become isolated while the
PLA was very ill. Bereavement support should be
available before the person dies and for as long
afterwards as people need it. People react to
death in different ways and need different types of
support. For some, it can take months or years to
come to terms with loss. People's responses may
be affected by the way the person died. If the PLA
died alone and in pain this might create a different
response than if he/she died peacefully,
surrounded by loved ones. Those left behind
often blame themselves if they think they could
have done more. Bereavement counselling
should:
• Give people an opportunity to talk about
events leading up to the death, about the
death itself and the rituals immediately
after the death;
• Reassure people that feelings of disbelief,
denial, sadness, pain and anger are
normal;
• Provide people with the opportunity to
express their feelings and concerns,
especially if it is difficult for them to do this
with friends and family;
• Enable family members and others to
accept the reality of their loss and start to
look to the future.
(See the guidelines for counselling under
Psychosocial Perspectives in the chapter 4
"Psychosocial Aspects of Counselling").

IS EQUIVOCAL
Figure 5:
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 44
COUNSELLING AND EDUCATION
HIV counselling and education have much in common,
such as their joint dependence on the ability of the
provider to communicate effectively, the role of
providing accurate information on HIV prevention
and care, the need to be culturally sensitive, and
the need to assess the knowledge of the client
before providing information. However, there are
also considerable differences between counselling and
education. Counselling is a confidential communication
that is provided in response to the needs of the client
and that provides emotional support in order to assist
individuals and families who may have HIV-related
problems or concerns. The following table outlines
these differences:
EDUCATION
COUNSELLING
• Provides verbal information in a timely manner
(on a need to know basis);
• Provides written information at an appropriate
level of understanding;
• Reinforces learning by demonstration and repeat
demonstration;
• Role plays various educational strategies;
• Reinforces learning by requesting the client to
repeat information;
• Supports and motivates clients to undertake
necessary behavioural change.
• Attends to the emotional needs of the client;
• Clarifies client's issues and concerns;
• Asks open-ended questions to fully explore
client's concern;
• Supports the client to fully explore concerns
related to risk behaviours;
• Summarizes and paraphrases salient issues ' of
concern;
• Responds to client's needs for support and care;
• Encourages client to seek support from others
(ie. Support groups);
• Makes necessary referrals to other care providers
at the client's request.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 45
It should be noted that although important
differences exist between these two important
skills, the HIV counsellor must be familiar with,
and capable of conducting both. That is, the
counsellor is both an effective interpersonal
communicator and an educator. Prevention of
HIV transmission requires that the counsellor be
an educator, and a motivator to promote
necessary behavioural change.
Behavioural Change
Throughout the world, a considerable
amount of literature has been devoted to the
psychological aspects of behavioural change. To
summarize this literature, there is general
agreement that promoting and ensuring
necessary behavioural change is very
challenging. In issues related to the prevention of
HIV transmission, the adoption of necessary
behavioural change is essential. Counsellors
must judge how best each client will respond to
changing at-risk behaviours. There is no set
formula that will ensure changes in behaviour.
Therefore, each client must be assessed to
ascertain which counselling and motivational
methods will be most effective. Usually, clients
respond to support, encouragement and
motivation. However, some clients respond better
when challenged and confronted by their risk
behaviours (see Chapter 5 for specific counselling
skills). Some factors that might influence
behavioural change in HIV positive clients
include:
• The need to protect his/her family from
HIV transmission;
• The need to appear trustworthy and
responsible within his family and
community;
• The desire to protect others (eg. sex
partners, injecting drug users etc.) from
HIV infection;
• The client's expressed desire to make
necessary changes to his/her behaviour;
• Evidence that prolonged risk behaviour
might contribute to further deterioration in
his/her health;
• The fear of further infecting him/herself
with HIV or other STDs;
• The fear that their risk behaviour will
become known to the community;
• The fear of stigma and isolation by loved
ones, and the general community if the
risk behaviours continue;
Counsellors can assess which of these factors
are present in each counselling session and
promote behavioural change, based on the
particular needs and desires of the client. It
should be noted that other issues (not listed here)
might also be the motivating factor leading to
behavioural change. The important counselling
strategy is one that highlights the factor that is
most likely to promote behavioural change, and
uses this factor to support and encourage risk
reduction. Motivation, support and
encouragement will be necessary over time, to
help sustain behavioural change. Also, the
counsellor should assess the cues that might
trigger behavioural change in each session.
Patient information should be provided (see
Appendix F).
The Use of Condoms
The safest form of prevention of sexually
transmitted HIV is abstinence. However, in most
instances, such practices are neither realistic nor
desirable. Barrier methods that prevent semen
and other body fluid from passing from one
partner to another are the next most effective
preventive methods. These barrier methods also
reduce the risk of STDS, however, they also act
as a contraceptive. The most effective barrier
method is the male condom. The female condom
is also effective, however, this barrier method is
less available of acceptable.
Male condom: the male condom is placed over
the erect penis before any penetration has
occurred. The condom then remains on the penis
until after ejaculation when it should be
immediately removed, knotted and discarded in a
safe place such as a toilet, latrine or in a safe
disposal unit. It is vitally important that people are
given accurate information and an opportunity to
practice using condoms. Information should be
given about how to place the condom on the erect
penis, leaving a space at the top to receive the
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 46
ejaculate, how to unroll the condom down the
shaft of the penis to the base, how to ensure that
the condom remains in place throughout
intercourse, and how to remove the condom
before the penis loses its erection. Practice using
condoms on a model or other article (such as a
banana or cucumber etc) are important. A new
condom must be used for each sexual act and
any damaged condom should be removed
immediately and a new one applied. It is essential
to have free, or very cheap condoms available in
places where people can access them in private
and without embarrassment. Easy access to
condoms should be available for both men and
women.
Counselling Strategies: Counsellors should feel
comfortable with discussing male condom use
and with demonstrating, on a model, how the
condom should be applied and removed. The
counsellor should ask the client to repeat the
demonstration.
Female condom: The female condom is a soft
yet strong polyurethane sheath, about the same
length as the male condom, but wider. A plastic
ring at the closed end helps keep the condom
fixed within the vagina during sex. A larger ring at
the opening stays outside the vagina, spreading
over the woman's external genital area. The
female condom provides extra protection to men
and women because it covers both the entrance
to the vagina and to the base of the penis. These
are areas where STD sores make it easy for HIV
to enter. Female condoms should only be used
once and do not need a prescription. However,
they are more expensive than male condoms and
not as easily acceptable or accessible. Because
the external ring is visible outside the vagina,
using a female condom might require the
agreement of both partners. However, because it
can be inserted hours before intercourse, it can
provide protection in situations where
consumption of alcohol or drugs may reduce the
chances that a male condom will be used. The
condom is inserted with the finger, making sure
no damage is done to the polyurethane by
fingernails or other sharp objects. The condom
should then fit snugly against the cervix. During
intercourse, it is necessary to guide the penis in
or check that the penis has entered the condom
and not entered the vagina outside the condom
wall The condom should be removed as soon as
possible after male ejaculation and disposed of in
the same ways as the male condom.
Counselling Strategies: It is important for the
counsellor to ascertain whether the female
condom is available in his/her area, if the condom
is available, then this option should be provided to
the client with a description on how to use the
condom and how to discard the condom after
use.
Other barrier methods: There are other barrier
methods that help reduce the sexual transmission
of HIV, but these are less reliable, and often not
as easily available. The female diaphragm
prevents semen from entering the cervix,
however, it does not protect the vagina or the
external genitalia from exposure to HIV.
Injecting Drug Users and other
Mood Altering Drugs
HIV can spread very rapidly among injecting drug
users (IDU), and thus to their sex partners and
eventually to their children. However, this spread
can be prevented or slowed down significantly if
interventions are designed which take into
account the specific local conditions and
characteristics of the IDUs. Injecting drug users
are usually a hidden and stigmatised group
because their behaviour is illegal. Often caught in
a cycle of poverty and faced with the cost of the
drugs, lUDs often engage in criminal activities
such as theft, and in high risk behaviours for HIV
infection such as commercial sex work and paid
blood donation. The only effective responses to
HIV transmission among IDUs to date are those
based on the philosophy of harm reduction. Harm
reduction is compatible with proven public health
principles, and need not conflict with demand and
supply reduction (law enforcement) programs.
Harm reduction programs approach drug abuse
primarily as a public health rather than a law and
order issue. Such programs take into account;
Promoting use of sterile equipment:
The most common pathway for HIV transmission
among IDUs is the sharing of non-sterile injecting
equipment. Scarcity, or lack of access to safe
injecting equipment, and legal sanctions against
possessing injecting equipment are the two main
reasons for reusing or sharing needles and
syringes. Another reason is ignorance of the risks
of HIV infection and prevention methods. The two
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 47
most basic strategies that have proven effective
are:
• The sale (at minimum cost), or free supply
of needles and syringes through
pharmacies or other outlets; and
• Needle and syringe exchange programs.
These exchange programs must be linked to
ensure that dirty syringes and needles are
exchanged for sterile ones. In addition, a vital
principle for community acceptance of these
programs is to ensure that needles and syringes
are safely and discretely disposed of after use,
and do not pose a threat to the general
population.
Harm reduction: Ball (1998) recommends a
hierarchy of decision making related to the
prevention of HIV through injecting drug use. At
the top of the risk hierarchy is the indiscriminate
sharing of injecting equipment, while at the
bottom is abstinence from all drug use. In moving
down the hierarchy, towards lowering risk,
prevention programs may be initiated to promote
behaviour change in:
• Reducing the frequency of sharing, and
the number of sharing partners,
• Cleaning injecting equipment with bleach,
• Not sharing injecting equipment.
• Using sterile needles and syringes, and
not sharing other equipment,
• Changing from the injection of illicit drugs
to use of non-injecting drugs,
• Reducing the frequency of non-injecting
drug use, and
• The abstinence from all drug use.
This hierarchy of decision-making can be a useful
framework to consider HIV prevention programs.
However, it should be noted that people do not
fall neatly into one of these categories. For
example, a person may regularly engage in a
needle and syringe exchange program, but,
because of unforeseen circumstances, finds
him/herself sharing used injecting equipment.
This hierarchy also assumes that there is
collaboration between the principles of public
health (ie. safe injection practices) and law
enforcement. This is not often the case. In order
for HIV prevention programs to be effective,
national and local policies must achieve a
balance between attempts to reduce the supply
and use of illicit drugs and support efforts to
decrease unsafe injection practices.
The principles of harm reduction that have been
proven effective in reducing HIV transmission in
IDUs include:
• Education, especially peer education and
counselling;
• Promotion of the use of sterile injecting
equipment for every injection; increasing
the availability of equipment; removing
barriers to access to use of sterile
equipment (especially policing and legal
barriers);
• Increasing drug treatment availability,
accessibility and options;
• Increasing access to primary health care,
particularly through services designed to
be "friendly" to, and appropriate for, the
IDU community;
• Research and education performed in
collaboration with the affected community.
Other mood altering drugs: It is important to
note that although IDU carries the greatest risk of
HIV transmission, taking other mood altering
drugs can also promote at risk behaviours.
Alcohol, and other legal and illegal drugs taken
orally or as an inhalant can affect a person's
decision-making capacity. In such circumstances,
the use of condoms is less likely, and other risk
behaviours and sexual practices might occur.
Counselling Strategies: The risk of HIV
transmission is greater in the drug taking
population because of the risks of injecting drug
use, taking other mood altering drugs, and the
practice of unprotected sexual relationships with
potentially HlV-infected partners. Such
counselling requires sensitivity (see Chapter 5),
challenging the risk behaviours (see Chapter 4),
and promoting risk reduction behavioural change
discussed earlier in this chapter. The counsellor
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 48
should review the guidelines on effective
communication, sensitivity, challenging (Chapter
5), and promoting behavioural change before
he/she undertakes counselling with this group of
high-risk clients.
Blood safety
There is a 90-95% chance that someone
receiving blood from an HIV infected person will
contract HIV. While millions of lives are saved
each year through blood transfusions, in countries
where a safe blood supply is not guaranteed,
recipients of blood run an increased risk of HlVinfection.
However, this risk can be virtually
prevented by a safe blood supply, and by using
blood transfusions appropriately. Difficulties
hindering a safe blood supply include:
• Lack of a national blood screening policy
and plan;
• Lack of an organized blood
transfusion service;
• Lack of safe donors or the presence of
unsafe donors;
• Lack of blood screening; and
• Unnecessary or inappropriate use of
blood.
Minimizing the risk of HIV infected blood
transfusions: Regulations on blood donations,
screening and transfusions are essential.
Pakistan is in the process of ratifying such
national regulations. It is then essential that these
regulations be rigorously enforced. Three
essential elements must be in place to ensure a
safe blood supply:
• There must be a national blood
transfusion service run on non-profit lines
that is answerable to the ministry of
health.
• Wherever possible, there should be a
policy of excluding all paid or professional
donors, but at the same time, encouraging
voluntary (non-paid) donors to come back
regularly. People are suitable donors only
if they are considered to have a low risk of
infection.
• All donated blood must be screened for
HIV, as well as for hepatitis B and syphilis
(and hepatitis C where possible).
Selecting blood donors: Paid donors very often
come from the poorest sectors of society. They
may be in poor health, undernourished and at risk
of having infections that can be passed on
through transfusions. In some places, paid donors
sell blood mainly to buy drugs to inject
themselves (often with shared, unsterile
equipment). In addition, paid donors are more
likely to give blood too often, with the result that
their blood may be substandard, and the donors
are likely to damage their own health.
In some countries, the use of replacement donors
has also been found to be problematic. In the
replacement donor system, families of people
needing a transfusion are asked to donate the
same quantity as that given to their relation. This
blood may be used directly for the relative, or
placed in the general pool. In Pakistan, the
replacement donors system accounts for the
largest quantity of donated blood.
The safest type of blood donor is the voluntary,
unpaid donor. Such donors donate their blood for
humanitarian reasons and are more likely to meet
national criteria for low-risk donors. Every effort
should be made to educate, motivate, recruit and
retain low-risk, unpaid donors. Systems are being
put in place to encourage voluntary, unpaid
donations from the general public in the larger
areas of Pakistan.
Benefits of VCT In blood donor services: A
fully implemented blood donor information and
counselling programme has the following
potential benefits:
• Wastage of blood units collected and
wasted costs from collection of HIVinfected
blood would be minimized.
• Blood donor HIV prevalence would be
reduced to below the national average.
• An uninfected donor pool would result.
Health care workers who are planning to start a
blood screening programme with adequate client
information, and pre and post HIV test counselling

Counselling for HIV/AIDS 51
There is no guarantee that blood can be 100% free
of HIV, however, with political commitment, good
organization, sufficient funding and donation of
blood from low-risk, voluntary, non-paid donors, the
risks can be reduced to a minimum.
Counselling Strategies: Pre-test counselling for
blood donors should start by providing the potential
blood donor with adequate information about HIV,
and how it is transmitted. This should be followed by
using the same guidelines as pre-test counselling
for clients requesting an HIV test (see Chapter 6).
Although these two populations might be very
different in terms of their risk behaviour, the same
counselling protocol should apply. It cannot be
assumed that blood donors are a low-risk
population. However, sensitivity is required to ask
some of the very personal questions related to
sexual activity and injecting drug use. Questions
should also be raised about previous blood
donation, and whether the client has received a
blood transfusion in the past. Depending on the
literacy level of the person, the client can complete
a checklist form (see Appendix C) him/herself which
can then be given to the person drawing blood. If
the client is illiterate, then the questions on the
checklist must be asked in person. It is often the
case that when a person is confronted by these
questions, if there is any doubt about whether their
behaviours might put them at risk for HIV, they
select to withdraw their offer of donating blood.
Although the blood is screened for HIV, such pretest
counselling is essential Should the client be
found to be HIV positive, every effort should be
made to contact this person, and provide post-test
counselling (see Chapter 6). If post-test counselling
is not available in the blood donor clinic, the person
should be referred to a setting where post-test
counselling can be carried out. Contact tracing
should also be carried out using the contact tracing
form (see Appendix E, Partner Notification Form).
Skin piercing practices
Skin piercing practices such as male circumcision,
other invasive surgery, and tattooing with un-sterile
equipment infected with HIV are other important
sources of HIV transmission. Counsellors should be
aware of these practices and help educate the
public about the risk of HIV transmission.
Counsellors can play an important role in public
education, and raise the awareness of using unsterile
equipment. Because it is impossible to know
if instruments or needles are infected with HIV,
counsellors should promote the practice of
sterilization of all surgical and medical equipment.
The counsellor should refer to information on
universal precautions to become more familiar with
this practice.
Health care workers are also at risk for HIV
transmission through needle sticks and other skin
piercing accidents. In addition, it is possible to
contact HIV though the mucous membranes, thus
any splashes to the eyes, or in the mouth with HIV
infected blood should be rinsed immediately.
Because it is impossible to be sure whether a
patient is infected with HIV, universal precautions
should be carried out in all patient care. It is beyond
the scope of the counsellor to educate health care
workers about universal precautions. However, the
counsellor can play an important role in raising
awareness about this problem. In addition, if a
health care worker does report a skin piercing injury,
or blood or mucous splash to the mouth or eyes, the
counsellor can play an important role in pre-test and
post-test counselling.
Counselling Strategies: An important role the
counsellor can perform is to raise the awareness of
the general public and health care workers about
the potential hazard of contracting HIV through skin
piercing practices or accidents. The promotion of
universal precautions should also be promoted.
Health care workers should be encouraged to report
accidents where transmission of HIV is possible. If a
health care worker reports such an accident, the
counsellor should then conduct pre-test counselling.
The details about sexual activity or potential
injecting drug use are not as important in this
instance. Instead, it is very important to write a
detailed report that highlights how the accident
occurred. The worker should then undergo an HIV
test. It is important to remember that HIV antibodies
can take from 3-6 months to be detectable in the
blood, and so the health care worker should be
encouraged to return for a second HIV test in 3
months' time. The first test will be used as a
baseline for a sero-negative status. Such accidents
should be reported to the hospital/clinic
administration. If possible, prophylactic antiretroviral
therapy should be given. The practice of
universal precautions is problematic in Pakistan,
and counsellors (and others) have a responsibility to
raise the awareness of this problem and to promote
behavioural change.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 52
POPULATIONS WITH SPECIAL
NEEDS
lthough HIV transmission is possible in
every segment of society, there are certain
populations that are at particular risk.
These populations include women, children,
families, health care workers, long haul lorry
drivers, migrant workers, commercial sex
workers, homosexuals, bisexuals, and
transvestites. This chapter will focus on the
special needs of women, couples and families.
Guidelines related to counselling for the potential
HIV transmission in health care workers were
addressed in Chapter 7. Counselling for other atrisk
populations was addressed in Chapters 5, 6
and 7. These previous chapters addressed
guidelines for effective counselling for at-risk
populations, and issues related to voluntary
testing and counselling.
The Vulnerability of Women
AIDS prevention campaigns often fail by women
assuming that they are at low risk, or by urging
prevention methods that women have little or no
power to apply, such as condom use, abstinence
and mutual faithfulness within a relationship.
Women continue to make strides towards equality
with men. However, for millions of women, this is
far from reality. These women are the most
vulnerable to HIV infection. In Pakistan, although
movements are being made toward greater
equality of women, this is still far from a reality.
Women are often dependent on their husbands
for the financial livelihood of themselves and their
children. In addition, many women have little
power or control in family affairs. This situation
leads women to having very little negotiating
power with their husbands, particularly when it
comes to negotiation about safe sex practices
and the use of condoms. Even when a woman
knows that her husband has engaged in high risk
practices (such as casual, unprotected sex with
others, or injecting drug use), she has little
negotiating power to protect herself from
infection.
Women are particularly vulnerable to HIV
infection for the following reasons:
Biological Vulnerability: Research shows that
the risk of becoming infected with HIV during
unprotected vaginal intercourse is as much as 2-4
times higher for women than men. Women are
also more vulnerable to other STDs (multiplying
the risk of contracting HIV 10-fold). One of the
major reasons for this is that women have a
bigger surface area of mucosa (the thin lining of
the vagina and cervix) exposed to their partners
secretions during sexual intercourse and semen
infected with HIV typically contains a higher
concentration of virus than a woman's sexual
secretions. Younger women are even more at risk
because their immature cervix and scant vaginal
secretions put up less of a barrier to HIV. Also,
they are prone to vaginal mucosa lacerations.
There is also evidence that women again become
more vulnerable after menopause. In addition,
tearing and bleeding during intercourse whether
from "rough sex", or rape multiplies the risk of HIV
infection. Anal intercourse (sometimes preferred
because it is thought to preserve virginity, and
avoids the risk of pregnancy) often tears the
delicate anal tissues and provides easy access to
the virus.
Social and economic vulnerability:
Prevention messages urging abstinence, fidelity
(faithfulness to one partner), condom use, needle
exchange programs (for intravenous drug users)
and encouraging and enabling people to get
prompt STD treatments have all helped avoid
HIV. However, for millions of women, their ability
to make these decisions and to act upon them is
crippled by their socio-economic circumstances.
The majority of women lack economic resources,
and are fearful of abandonment or violence from
their male partner. Thus they have little or no
control over how and when they have sex, and
hence over their risk of becoming infected
A
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 53
with HIV. This vulnerability is compounded by:
• Traditional norms and values: In
Pakistan, the majority of women are
expected to stay home and raise their
family. Although this is an important family
value, this often places the woman at an
economic disadvantage. Thus the power
she has in the relationship could be
reduced, and the possibility of negotiating
for safer sex practices is also at risk.
• Lack of education: Millions of young girls
are brought up with little knowledge of
their reproductive system or how HIV and
STDs are transmitted (and prevented).
• Sexual customs and norms:
Typically, women are expected to leave
the initiative and decision-making in sex to
males whose needs and demands are
expected to dominate. There is often a
tolerance for a double standard in that
women are blamed or abandoned for
infidelity (real or suspected), while such
practices are tolerated in men.
• Lack of economic opportunities: Failure
to respect the rights of women to equal
access to education and employment
opportunities reinforces their dependence
on men. Women commercial sex workers
view sex as a "currency".
• Lack of control In relationships: Even
when a woman suspects her partner has
HIV, she often cannot risk losing his
support by refusing sex, or insisting on
condom use. She would be breaking the
"conspiracy of silence" that surrounds
extramarital sex by either partner.
Although some men may agree to use
condoms, others react with anger,
violence and abandonment.
• STDs and HIV: Because STDs carry a
heavy social stigma (especially for
women), women tend to avoid STD clinics
and treatment. Women are often
socialized to accept ill health and
especially "women's troubles" as their lot
in life.
• HIV and prostitution: Prostitutes have
little power to protect themselves from
HIV. Women often turn to prostitution as
an alternative to poverty. Many sex
workers risk violence or loss of income if
they request the use of condoms,
however, some commercial sex workers
have found ways to negotiate condom
use. These sex workers wait until the
client is erect, and then demand condom
use. At this stage, the men usually
conform.
The Counsellor's Role In Fostering
Empowerment
Women's vulnerability comes from lack of
power and control over their risk of HIV.
Although counsellors cannot take on the
whole role of promoting empowerment for
women, they can act as an important resource
and role model to others. Strategies for
fostering empowerment in women include:
• Combating Ignorance: Promote the
improvement in education for women,
including education about their bodies,
STDs and AIDS. Women and girls can
also learn the skills to say no to unwanted
or unsafe sex. Provide women-friendly
services.
• Ensuring girls and women have access
to appropriate health and HIV/STD
prevention and care services: These
services should be at places and times
that are convenient and acceptable to
them. Promote voluntary testing and
counselling, and teach about condom use.
Make these services easily available
without embarrassment.
• Building safer norms: Support women's
groups and community organizations in
questioning behavioural traditions that
have become deadly in the AIDS
epidemic. Educate boys and to respect
girls and women, and to engage in
responsible sexual behaviour.
• Reinforcing women's economic
independence: Encourage and
strengthen existing training, education and
employment opportunities for women.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 54
Mother to Child Transmission of HIV
Mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the
major means of HIV infection in children. Without
preventive treatment, up to 40% of children born to
HIV-positive women will be infected. Of those who are
infected through MTCT, it is believed that about 2/3
are infected during pregnancy and around the time of
delivery, and about 1/3 are infected through breastfeeding.
Most of the transmission in pregnancy occurs
at the time of labour and delivery (more than 60%).
Using the most widely available tests it is not possible
to tell whether a newborn infant has already been
infected with HIV. The child of an infected mother may
have maternal antibodies in his/her blood until 18
months of age. Therefore, testing cannot be used to
help make decisions about whether or not to breastfeed
the baby.
Counselling Strategies: Counsellors can play an
important role in preventing HIV transmission to sexual
partners and children. Certain issues are important to
consider in counselling women, couples and families.
Table 4 provides a checklist for counselling pregnant
women.
Counselling Women
It is often preferable for women counsellors to counsel
women. It is especially important to help the woman
feel safe in the counselling session. Counselling an
infected woman should take into consideration how
she has learned of her condition. A woman often
discovers her infection by accident; sometimes after
her husband, or child show symptoms of HIV infection.
The first concern addressed by many women is the
concern they have for their children. The counsellor
should understand that the woman is dealing with two
crises; the crisis of her husband or child's illness, and
her own feelings and emotions. In addition, if the
woman discovers that she is HIV-positive, she has the
stress of disclosing this news to her partner and family.
Anger, fear, and guilt are common feelings
experienced by HlV-infected women (see Chapter 4 for
counselling strategies to assist the woman). Even if the
woman was infected through her partner, she will need
considerable support when disclosing her condition to
others. HlV-infected women often feel extremely lonely
and isolated. Fear of social stigma may compel her to
keep the condition secret. Women fear being
abandoned, and deprived of the support of family,
friends and community organizations. Helping the
woman re-establish connections with family and other
social groups is often a major task in counselling.
Helping women establish peer group support can also
be an important counselling strategy.
Couple and family Counselling
Couple and family counselling will depend on the HIV
status of the parents and the children. Experience has
shown that couples and families lead a better quality of
life, access necessary resources, and support each
other more if they are able to fully disclose their HIV
status, and means of transmission. This disclosure can
be very stressful for the family, and some families
separate as a result of this disclosure. However, with
support from the counsellor, such disclosure is most
often very beneficial. If either of the couple is HIVpositive,
then unless condoms are used, there is the
risk of infecting the other partner. Counselling about
planned pregnancies requires sensitivity and tact. The
couple should be counselled about the risk of HIV
transmission to the wife, with subsequent transmission
to the child. The counsellor must be aware of these
risks and provide factual information to the potential
parents in a manner that is easily understood. It will
then be up to the parents to make an informed
decision about whether to have a child or not.
Similarly, if the woman is HIV infected, the couple
should be counselled about the potential risk to the
baby during pregnancy, labour, delivery and through
breast feeding. It is the responsibility of the counsellor
to provide this factual information about the risks of
HIV transmission and then allow the potential parents
to make an informed decision. If the woman is HIVpositive
and is already pregnant, the counsellor can
raise the issue of pregnancy termination. This type of
counselling requires considerable sensitivity to the
problems and needs of the couple. In addition, it is
essential that the counsellor refers the couple to other
necessary community resources, support groups and
in particular, to medical care.
Counselling families with an HlV-infected child requires
considerable sensitivity. Parents usually feel guilty
about this HIV transmission and grief at the thought of
loosing the child. These emotions are normal and
should be openly discussed and explored (see
Chapter 4). Parents must be helped to deal with their
own emotional reactions so that they can provide a
level of stability in the home. The counsellor should
provide practical advice about caring for the child in
the home, or refer the family to other resources that
are better equipped to help the family in this matter. An
important role the counselor can
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 55
Pretest Counselling
• Patients request for HIV testing
should be honoured. She has the right to
ask and to be taken seriously
• Explore patient's HIV risk history and
discuss the reasons for recommending
test.
• Discuss the potential for reducing risk to
the fetus if the patient turns out to be HIV
positive.
• Discuss ways HIV is transmitted (anal or
vaginal intercourse, blood transmission).
• Explain test limitation (3-6 months
window period).
• Explain length of time until test result is
available
• Review safe sex and safe IV drug
practices.
• Consider psychological implications of
testing including the anxiety she may feel
waiting for the result.
• Does the patient have an adequate
support system? Someone she feels she
can talk to if the test is positive?
• Discuss the advisability of partner testing?
• Obtain informed consent for test. Verbal
consent is adequate if a short explanatory
note is recorded in the chart.
• A patient has the right to decline testing.
Post-test Counselling
It is imperative to give HIV test results in person
and never to do so over the phone, particularly by
leaving messages.
Negative Test:
• Explain test result-interpret test result (not
infected up to 6 month previously).
take is to encourage the family show affection to
the child, and to treat the child as normally as
possible. The counsellor should also encourage
the parents to tell the child about his/her condition
as soon as the child is able to understand and
cope with this news. This disclosure helps the
child adjust to his/her condition and promotes
access to other necessary resources.
• Discuss any need for repeat testing if at
risk within 6 months.
• Review healthy living and risk reduction.
• Refer to Positive Women’s Network or AN
Clinic if they want to talk further about
safer sex. This can be done anonymously
by phone if they wish.
Positive Test:
Necessary, first visit-counselling
• Explain test result/provide reassurance
about patient’s immediate safety
(difference between HIV and AIDS).
• Ensure support

follow-up appointment)
o Potential support of family and

Counselling for HIV/AIDS 56
STRATEGIES TO INTRODUCE AND
SUPPORT HIV COUNSELLING SERVICES
t is often the case that little value placed on
counselling which receives little (if any)
financial support. As a result, counselling
services are often fragmented, with no designated
time or place for sessions. In addition, health care
professionals have to fit counselling into their
already overburdened work life, with little financial
compensation. It is difficult for health care
workers and other care professionals to value this
important role when counselling is thus undervalued
by policy makers and government officials.
It is therefore encouraging to note that Pakistan is
moving toward the introduction of HIV
counselling. These counselling services will be
available for people who wish voluntary testing
and counselling (VCT) for an expressed issue or
concern, and also to potential blood donors. It is
important to note that whether the person comes
to donate blood, or with an expressed desire for
HIV testing, that pre-test counselling be
performed for all people (see Chapter 6).
However, it should also be noted that if the client
refuses pre-test counselling, HIV testing should
still be performed at the client's request. Although
the pretest counselling might be slightly different
in the case of a person requesting an HIV test,
and those coming to donate blood, the same
factual information is necessary in both
circumstances. The guidelines for pre-test
counselling are found in Chapter 6 and the issues
related to counselling and blood donation are
found in Chapter 7.
In addition, all clients should be offered post-test
counselling regardless of the result. Post-test
counselling will be different, depending on the
result, however, post-test counseling for all clients
is essential to help prevent the transmission of
HIV and to help people live healthier lives.
Research and experience has shown that people
who receive post-test counselling (regardless of
the result), with adequate information (see
Appendix F) are better motivated to make
necessary behavioural change, access support
and other resources, and live a better quality of
life.
Elements for Effective VCT Services
Ideally, all health and social service workers
should be trained in effective HIV counselling.
Although this is a daunting task, it should be
acknowledged that the more people who are
aware of, and practice effective HIV counselling,
the more likely will be the control of HIV
transmission. Some particular strategies for
consideration in the introduction and support
counselling services include:
• Convincing the decision makers about the
need and value of counselling services by
quoting evidence of services in other
communities or countries, or starting a
small evaluation project in your area;
• Providing adequate financial
compensation for counsellors;
• Ensuring proper selection of counselling
trainees. These people should be good
listeners, respected by others, motivated
and resilient and have warm and caring
personalities;
• Providing training workshops followed by
supervised practice and ongoing training;
• Providing instrumental and psychological
support to the counsellors;
• Attending to the location and time of
services. The time of services should
address accessibility for women, men,
youth and couples. In addition, the
location of the service could be broadened
to include maternal and child health
clinics, hospital out patient clinics,
community based programs, STD and TB
clinics etc. These locations could help
reduce the stigma attached to an
exclusive HIV or STD clinic.
I
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 57
• Having adequate supply of condoms (with
information on use);
• Going to where the people are, eg.
commercial sex workers, intravenous drug
users, and other high risk populations;
• Introducing educational campaigns to increase
HIV awareness, and of counselling services;
• Recruiting confidential, respectful and caring
staff;
• Providing adequate referral services eg. to
other counsellors, laboratory testing, support
services, treatment management,
maternal/child health services, STD clinics,
family planning centres etc.;
• Setting up appropriate counseling standards
and protocols.
Care for the Caregiver
There is considerable documentation to suggest that
counsellors need ongoing support and care.
Counselling requires sensitivity, courage, and an
unerring trust in people to make the best decisions for
themselves given adequate understanding and
support. Working with people as they explore deep
and personal emotions and issues can be draining.
Caring for someone who is sick and dying, often in
difficult circumstances with few resources can be very
stressful for these counsellors. Support for the
counsellors can be achieved by attending to the
following:
• The provision of counselling services and
other forms of support.
• Continuing education related to HIV and to
counselling strategies and skills;
• Peer support for the counsellors as well as
periodic peer review of their counselling skills
and strategies.
Even in poorer areas where there is little financial
support for counselling services, bureaucrats and
policy makers should recognise the need for
counsellor support. In addition, counsellors should be
encouraged to seek the support they need. They
should look to other counsellors as a source of
support, or talk over some of their burden with their
family and friends. These counsellors do not need to
breech confidentiality to explore their feelings and
frustrations with others. Only when counsellors are
adequately cared for can they provide the necessary
care and support to their clients.

PARTNER NOTIFICATION FORM
You have tested positive (reactive) for antibodies
to HIV. You can help prevent HIV from being
transmitted to others by making sure that your
past and present partners are notified that they
may have had a contact with HIV. This applies to
all sexual partners with whom you have had
unprotected sex (anal, vaginal or oral sex without
using a latex condom) as well as anyone with
whom you may have shared needles or syringes.
If you know approximately when you were
infected, notify all partners you have had since
that date. If you do not know when you were
infected, discuss notification with you counsellor
or health care worker.
YOUR PARTNERS CAN BE NOTIFIED BY:
• Yourself, in person (with or without the
assistance of your health care worker, or
HIV counsellor), by telephone or by letter.
• ANONYMOUSLY, by filling out this
Partner Notification Form.
Mail or deliver this form
to:____________________
OR
Mail or deliver this form to your local health unit.
You may decide to notify some partners
personally, and use this form for others. Your
confidentiality will be protected as there is no
need for you to put your name on this form.
YOU CAN PREPARE FOR PARTNER
NOTIFICATION BY:
• Emotionally preparing yourself by
anticipating partner responses.
• Seeking assistance and advice from
someone knowledgeable about HIV
infection.
• Notifying in a confidential, safe setting,
free from interruptions.
• Notifying all partners as soon as possible.
• Reminding partners that being HIV
positive is not a diagnosis of AIDS.
• Providing information brochures and
referral services names and numbers.
Encourage partners to reduce their risks of HIV
transmission and to access information,
counselling and possible testing through STD
control clinic, health unit/Clinic, doctor, blood
donor centre, or other HIV testing facilities.

APPENDIX-F
CLIENT INFORMATION
GUIDELINES FOR SOMEONE WHO IS HIV
POSITIVE
WHAT DOES BEING HIV POSITIVE MEAN?
Your blood shows antibodies to HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus). This means that you are
carrying this virus and can pass HIV on to others
through sexual and/or blood contact and through
breast milk. This is called being reactive to HIV
and is sometimes referred to as being HIV
positive. Being HIV positive does not mean that
you have the disease AIDS.
WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP?
The management of HIV changed in 1996.
Currently all newly diagnosed HIV positive
persons are encouraged to get a medical
assessment done by the doctor. In some places,
a viral load test can be done which will measure
the amount of HIV in your blood. This test along
with other blood tests and a complete medical
examination will aid your doctor in recommending
whether the time is right for you to be considering
treatment. Treatment is expensive, and
unfortunately, not available to everyone. Testing
for tuberculosis is recommended when the person
is HIV positive. There are several vaccinations for
other communicable diseases, which should be
considered at this time. It is important to have a
physician who will work with you to coordinate
your case.
Additional confidential support (both medical and
emotional) is available from your local health unit.
ARE THERE WAYS TO PREVENT THE
SPREAD OF THIS INFECTION?..YES!
Practice Safer Sex
Avoid unprotected anal, vaginal and oral sex.
Always use latex condoms. (Latex condom when
properly used, significantly reduces transmission
of sexually transmitted disease including HIV)
Use unlubricated condoms for oral sex. Plastic
wrap and dental dams or latex gloves can be
used as a barrier from vaginal secretions and
blood when performing oral sex on a woman.
HIV is transmitted by exposure to infected semen,
vaginal secretions and blood. The risk of passing
on HIV to a sexual partner increases if the partner
has open sores, cuts, inflamed or bleeding
membranes, herpes lesions or other sexually
transmitted diseases.
You won't infect others by touching or hugging. If
you have questions about the kind of contact that
are safe ask a health care worker or HIV
counsellor.
ALSO
Consult with your doctor about pregnancy. If
you are pregnant, inquire about medications that
might be available to decrease the risk of HIV
transmission from you to your unborn baby.
Do not share your needle or syringes if you
inject drugs. Call your local health unit for
information on needle exchanges and on
treatment programs.
Do not donate blood, sperm, tissue, bone
marrow, organs or breast milk. If you have
been a donor in the past, please advise your
doctor so that the agencies receiving the
donations can be contacted.
Advise health and dental caregivers to take
blood and body fluid precautions or tell them you
have tested positive for HIV.
NOTIFY ANY PARTNERS THAT YOU HAVE
HAD UNPROTECTED SEX WITH OR ANY
PERSONS WHO YOU HAVE SHARED A
NEEDLE WITH. TELL THEM THEY MAY BE
HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO HIV AND SHOULD
CONSIDER HAVING AN HIV ANTIBODY TEST.

LOVING CAREFULLY
PREVENTION: HOW DO I AVOID GETTING A
SEXUAUY TRANSMITTED DISEASE?
There are two ways to avoid getting infected by a
sexually transmitted disease.
1. ABSTINENCE This means choosing not to
have sexual intercourse. You
can still share a very loving
and caring relationship with
someone without having sex.
2. CONDOMS If you are sexually active you
need to use a latex condom
correctly every time you have
intercourse. It only takes
once to catch a disease or
get pregnant.
AIDS is caused by the HIV virus, which attacks
the body's immune system making it susceptible
to common infections and unusual cancers. The
AIDS virus is present in blood, semen and vaginal
secretions. It can be spread by:
• Sexual contact with an infected person
• Sharing contaminated needles and
syringes
• An infected mother to infant eg. at birth or
by breast-feeding.
Symptoms: Persistent unexplained fever,
night sweats, weight loss,
diarrhoea, swollen glands,
extreme fatigue, and skin
rashes. Unfortunately the
person is contagious after
becoming infected with the
disease, long before the
symptoms occur.
Complications: Kaposi's Sarcoma and other
forms of cancer, pneumonia,
blindness, deteriorating mental
state, overwhelming infections.
Treatment: At this time there is no cure for
AIDS. It is critical to take
protective measures, eg. using
latex condoms, to prevent
infection by this virus.
Steps To Take If You are HIV Positive
If you tested positive on the HIV antibody test,
this newsletter is for you. It will tell you what you
can do to slow down the virus and protect your
health and the health of others.
Testing positive means that you have been
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
People who are HIV-positive may develop AIDS
in the future.
The most important steps are:
• Getting emotional support.
• Getting good medical care.
• Keeping healthy habits.
Emotional Support
Emotional support is the help that you receive
from other people. If you get emotional support,
you won't feel so alone dealing with HIV.
When you find out that you are HIV-positive, it
can be very tough. You may feel lonely, angry,
depressed, or afraid of getting sick. These are
very common feelings among people who test
positive.
Some people who are HIV-positive discuss their
feelings with their friends, family, or lovers. Others
prefer to see a personal counsellor and get
individual support.
Another option is to join a support group or to
start one. A support group lets you talk to other
people who are facing the same issues.
Emotional support is especially helpful in the first
few months after getting your test results. Once
you sort out some of your feelings, you can start
thinking about what you can do to keep healthy.
Some people who test positive feel the need to
start doing something right away to stop the virus.
Others may feel there is nothing they can do
against HIV infection. The truth is there is a lot
that can be done to improve your chances of
staying healthy. Most people who are HIVpositive
live with no symptoms for many years
after being infected. Some of them have been
healthy for more than eleven years.
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 68
Medical Care
Medical care is very important in finding out
whether the virus has caused any damage to your
body. You may feel completely healthy now.
However, HIV could already be hurting your
immune system.
Your immune system helps you fight diseases.
HIV destroys a part of your immune system. If this
happens, your body is open to attack from many
diseases.
A doctor can check how healthy you are and help
you make decisions about treatment. Sometimes
you won't need to see a doctor. Some hospitals
and clinics have nurses and other medical
persons who can work with you. The first step is
to figure out what medical care you can get.
Once You Have a Doctor---
You and your doctor will need to get a general
picture of how healthy you are. The goals are:
• To understand what effect HIV has had on
your immune system. Some lab tests will
give your doctor information about how
well your immune system is working. The
most common test available is the Thelper
cell count.
• To know if you have been exposed to
other diseases that could become
problems in the future. Syphilis,
tuberculosis and hepatitis-B or C are
some examples.
Keeping Healthy Habits
There are some habits that may help your body
stay healthy.
• Eating a balanced diet
• Getting plenty of sleep every night
• Getting regular exercise.
Some clinics and hospitals have staff who can
help you choose good eating habits. If you are
having trouble sleeping, talk to a doctor or
counsellor.
Habits that are not good for your health
include:
• Smoking
• Drinking alcohol
• Taking or shooting drugs.
If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you
can seek help from a treatment programme or
support group.
There is no way to tell you what changes will work
for you. Changing habits is a very personal
decision. For example, some people can stop
drinking alcohol or taking drugs altogether. Some
people can cut down how much they drink or use
drugs. For others, making any change is very
hard and stressful. You will need to decide for
yourself what habits you can change, and how
you will change them.
Drug Use---
If you shoot drugs, never share your needles. If
you have to share a needle, clean it first with
bleach. Cleaning your needles protects both your
partners and you. HIV, hepatitis-B &amp; C and other
diseases can be transmitted through dirty
needles.
If you use other drugs, remember that they can
alter your mood and might cause you to start
taking risks that could harm your health. This
includes having unsafe sex.
If you do inject drugs and cannot get a clean
needle and syringe each time, follow these
important steps:
To clean your needle, fill it with bleach and squirt
it out. Do this again. Then fill it with water and
squirt it out. Do this again.
Having Sex---
If you have sex and are HIV-positive, you need to
protect yourself and others by always having safe
sex. Safe sex means not letting your blood,
semen or vaginal fluids get inside your partner.
The safest form of sex is with a condom. Using a
new condom each time, and disposing of the
used one.
When you have safe sex, you keep your sexual
partners from getting infected. Safe sex also
keeps you from getting re-infected with HIV and
from catching other sexually transmitted
Counselling for HIV/AIDS 69
diseases. In other words, safe sex protects both
you and your partner. The best way to have safe
sex is to use a condom. If you have any questions
about how to have safe sex call your local health
care worker.
If you need help telling a sexual partner that you
are HIV positive, talk to a counsellor, or health
care worker.
Some Final Words
Starting some of these steps will take time and
energy. However, you can get a gain a lot from
these changes. Protecting your health and the
health of others can give you a sense of control
over HIV disease and can extend your life.
